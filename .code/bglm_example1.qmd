# Scenario

Here is an example from @Fowler-1998-1998. An agriculturalist was
interested in the effects of fertilizer load on the yield of grass.
Grass seed was sown uniformly over an area and different quantities of
commercial fertilizer were applied to each of ten 1 m<sup>2</sup>
randomly located plots.  Two months later the grass from each plot was
harvested, dried and weighed.  The data are in the file
**fertilizer.csv** in the **data** folder.

The aim of the analysis is to investigate the relationship between
fertilizer concentration and grass yield.


# Read in the data

We will start off by reading in the Fertilizer data.  There are many functions
in R that can read in a CSV file.  We will use a the `read_csv()` function as it
is part of the tidyverse ecosystem.

```{r}
#| label: readData
fert <- read_csv("../public/data/fertilizer.csv", trim_ws = TRUE)
```

<!-- START_PRIVATE-->
After reading in a dataset, it is always a good
idea to quickly explore a few summaries in order to ascertain whether
the imported data are correctly transcribed. In particular, we should
pay attention to whether there are any unexpected missing values and
ensure that each variable (column) has the expected class (e.g. that
variables we expected to be considered numbers are indeed listed as
either `<dbl>` or `<int>` and not `<char>`).

# Exploratory data analysis
 
<!-- START_PRIVATE-->
The individual responses ($y_i$, observed yields) are each
expected to have been **independently** drawn from normal (**Gaussian**)
distributions ($\mathcal{N}$). These distributions represent all the possible
yields we could have obtained at the specific ($i^{th}$) level of Fertilizer.
Hence the $i^{th}$ yield observation is expected to have been drawn from a normal
distribution with a mean of $\mu_i$.

Although each distribution is expected to come from populations that differ in
their means, we assume that all of these distributions have the **same
variance** ($\sigma^2$).

We need to supply priors for each of the parameters to be estimated ($\beta_0$,
$\beta_1$ and $\sigma$).  Whilst we want these priors to be sufficiently vague
as to not influence the outcomes of the analysis (and thus be equivalent to the
frequentist analysis), we do not want the priors to be so vague (wide) that they
permit the MCMC sampler to drift off into parameter space that is both illogical
as well as numerically awkward.

As a starting point, lets assign the following priors (how we arrive
on these values will be outlined in sections on defining priors):

- $\beta_0$: Normal prior centred at 164 with a variance of 65
- $\beta_1$: Normal prior centred at 0 with a variance of 1
- $\sigma$: either a half cauchy centred at 0 with a variance of 2 or an
  exponential with parameter of 0.016

Note, when fitting models through either `rstanarm` or `brms`, the priors assume
that the predictor(s) have been centred and are to be applied on the link
scale.  In this case the link scale is an identity.

<!-- START_PRIVATE-->
We intend to explore the relationship between
Yield and Fertiliser using simple linear regression.  Such an analysis
assumes:

- **Normality**: each population is assumed to be normally
  distributed. This can be initially assessed by exploring the
  distribution of the response via either boxplots, violin plots or
  histograms (depending on sample size).
- **Homogeneity of variance**: each population is assumed to be
  equally varied.  This can be initially assessed by exploring the
  distribution of observed values around an imaginary line of best fit
  through the cloud of data formed by a scatterplot of Yield against
  Fertiliser. If the spread of points increases (or decreases) along
  the trend line, it is likely that the populations are not equally
  varied.
- **Linearity**: in fitting a straight line through the cloud of data,
  we are assuming that a linear trend is appropriate. If the trend is
  not linear, then the inferred relationship may be
  miss-representative of the true relationship.  In addition to an
  imaginary line, we could fit either a loess or linear smoother
  through the cloud to help us assess the likelihood of non-linearity.
- **Independence**: to help ensure that the estimates are unbiased, we
  must assume that all observations are independent. In this case, we
  assume that the observations were collected from a randomised design
  in which the level of Fertiliser was applied randomly to the
  different patches of the field. If however, the researchers had
  simply moved along the field applying progressively higher
  Fertiliser concentrations, then there is a chance that they have
  introduced additional biases or confounding factors. Similarly, if
  the Fertiliser levels were applied in increasing doses over time,
  there might also be biases. In the absence of any spatial or
  temporal information associated with the collection of data, we
  cannot directly assess this assumption.

**Conclusions**:

- there is no evidence of non-normality, non-homogeneity of variance
  or non-linearity
- we have no initial reason to suspect that the assumptions will not
  be satisfied and thus it is reasonable to assume that the results
  will be reliable.

# Fit the model 

Note, for routines that take more than a couple of seconds to perform
(such as most Bayesian models), it is a good idea to cache the
Rmarkdown chunks in which the routine is performed. That way, the
routine will only be run the first time and any objects generated will
be stored for future use. Thereafter, provided the code has not
changed, the routine will not be re-run. Rather, `knitr` will just
retrieve the cached objects and continue on.

One of the most difficult aspects of performing Bayesian analyses is
the specification of priors.  For instances where there are some
previous knowledge available and a desire to incorporate those data,
the difficulty is in how to ensure that the information is
incorporated correctly.  However, for instances where there are no
previous relevant information and so a desire to have the posteriors
driven entirely by the new data, the difficulty is in how to define
priors that are both vague enough (not bias results in their
direction) and yet not so vague as to allow the MCMC sampler to drift
off into unsupported regions (and thus get stuck and yield spurious
estimates).

For early implementations of MCMC sampling routines (such as
Metropolis Hasting and Gibbs), it was fairly common to see very vague
priors being defined.  For example, the priors on effects, were
typically normal priors with mean of 0 and variance of `1e+06`
(1,00,000).  These are very vague priors.  Yet for some samplers
(e.g. NUTS), such vague priors can encourage poor behaviour of the
sampler - particularly if the posterior is complex. It is now
generally advised that priors should (where possible) be somewhat
**weakly informative** and to some extent, represent the bounds of
what are feasible and sensible estimates.

The degree to which priors __influence__ an outcome (whether by having
a pulling effect on the estimates or by encouraging the sampler to
drift off into unsupported regions of the posterior) is dependent on:

- the relative sparsity of the data - the larger the data, the less
  weight the priors have and thus less influence they exert.
- the complexity of the model (and thus posterior) - the more
  parameters, the more sensitive the sampler is to the priors.

The sampled posterior is the product of both the likelihood and the
prior - all of which are multidimensional.  For most applications, it
would be vertically impossible to define a sensible multidimensional
prior.  Hence, our only option is to define priors on individual
parameters (e.g. the intercept, slope(s), variance etc) and to hope
that if they are individually sensible, they will remain collectively
sensible.

So having (hopefully) impressed upon the notion that priors are an
important consideration, I will now attempt to synthesise some of the
approaches that can be employed to arrive at weakly informative priors
that have been gleaned from various sources.  Largely, this advice has
come from the following resources:

- https://github.com/stan-dev/stan/wiki/Prior-Choice-Recommendations
- http://svmiller.com/blog/2021/02/thinking-about-your-priors-bayesian-analysis/

I will outline some of the current main recommendations before
summarising some approaches in a table.

- weakly informative priors should contain enough information so as to
  regularise (discourage unreasonable parameter estimates whilst
  allowing all reasonable estimates).
- for effects parameters on scaled data, an argument could be made for
  a normal distribution with a standard deviation of 1
  (e.g. `normal(0,1)`), although klsome prefer a t distribution with 3
  degrees of freedom and standard deviation of 1
  (e.g. `student_t(3,0,1)`) - apparently a flatter t is a more robust
  prior than a normal as an uninformative prior...
- for unscaled data, the above priors can be scaled by using the
  standard deviation of the data as the prior standard deviation
  (e.g. `student_t(3,0,sd(y))`, or `sudent_t(3,0,sd(y)/sd(x))`)
- for priors of hierachical standard deviations, priors should
  encourage shrinkage towards 0 (particularly if the number of groups
  is small, since otherwise, the sampler will tend to be more
  responsive to "noise").

1. In the above, for non-Gaussian families, `y` is first transformed
  according to the family link.  If the family link is `log`, then 0.1
  is first added to 0 values.
2. in `brms` the minimum standard deviation for the Intercept prior is
   `2.5`
3. in `brms` the minimum standard deviation for group-level priors is
   `10`.

`rstanarm`

http://mc-stan.org/rstanarm/articles/priors.html

1. in `rstanarm` priors on standard deviation and correlation
   associated with group-level effects are packaged up into a single
   prior (`decov` which is a decomposition of the variance and
   covariance matrix).

## frequentist

For the purpose of comparing the frequentist and Bayesian outcomes, it might be
useful to start by fitting the frequentist simple linear model.  We will also
fit this model with the predictor (fertilizer concentration) centred.

```{r lm, results='markdown', eval=TRUE, mhidden=TRUE}
summary(fert.lm <- lm(YIELD ~ FERTILIZER, data = fert))
sigma(fert.lm) 
summary(fert.lm <- lm(YIELD ~ center(FERTILIZER), data = fert))
sigma(fert.lm)
```

## rstanarm 
:::: {.panel-tabset}

### Using default priors
In `rstanarm`, the default priors are designed to be weakly informative. They
are chosen to provide moderate regularisation (to help prevent over-fitting) and
help stabilise the computations.

```{r fitModel1a, results='markdown', eval=TRUE, mhidden=TRUE, cache=TRUE}
fert.rstanarm <- stan_glm(YIELD ~ FERTILIZER,
                          data=fert,
                          iter = 5000,
                          warmup = 1000,
                          chains = 3,
                          thin = 5,
                          refresh = 0)
```

In the above:

- the formula and data arguments should be familiar as they are the same as for
  many models in R
- iter: indicates the number of MCMC iterations to perform per chain
- warmup: indicates how many of the initial MCMC samples to exclude.  During the
  warmup stage, the MCMC sampler is tuning its sampling operations to allow it
  to determine the best way to create the chain.  While it is in this discovery
  phase, the estimates it produces might be unrepresentative.
- chains: indicates the number of independent chains to run.  The more chains,
  the more random starts.  The point of multiple random starts is to minimise
  the potential for the starting point to dictate the outcome.  It is possible
  that a chain might get stuck sampling a single feature of the posterior and not discover
  additional features.  Additional random starting points should hopefully
  alleviate this. Either 3 or 4 is typical.
- thin: indicates the rate at which the MCMC samples should be thinned in order
  to eliminate auto-correlation between MCMC samples.  When the step lengths
  between MCMC samples are small, the resulting parameter estimates will be
  auto-correlated (since samples close by in the chain will be more similar than
  those far apart).  The rate of thinning necessary will depend on the degree
  of auto-correlation.  For stan models, a thinning rate of 5 is a good starting
  point.
- refresh: indicates how often the terminal display should be updated.  When
  running a large model, this can be useful as it provides a form of progress.
  However, when the routine is within an Rmarkdown document, it just results in
  the output including each line of progress and a lot of space is taken up unnecessarily

Having allowed `rstanarm` to formulate its own weakly informative priors, it is
a good idea to explore what they are.  Firstly, out of curiosity, it might be
interesting to see what it has chosen.  However, more importantly, we need to be
able to document what the priors were and the `rstanarm` development team make
it very clear that there is no guarantee that the default priors will remain the
same into the future. 

```{r fitModel1b, results='markdown', eval=TRUE, mhidden=TRUE}
prior_summary(fert.rstanarm)
```

Note, consistent with good practice, `rstanarm` will centre all
categorical predictors (whether the user centres them or not).  Whilst
this does not impact on estimated slope(s), it does alter the
intercept (arguably for the better).  Since all priors are applied on
the scale of the parameters in the linear predictor (e.g. the
intercept and slopes), the prior on intercept must be defined as if
the predictors have been centred.

Nevertheless, `rstanarm` will return a posterior for intercept that is
consistent with how the user had defined the linear predictor - that
is, if the user does not centre the predictors, then `rstanarm` will
return the intercept posterior on a scale consistent with as if the
predictors had not been centred, even though they were automatically
scaled internally.

When defining the spread of priors, `rstanarm` prefers to do so
relative to the scaling of the data.  For example, for the slope, it
takes the ratio of the standard deviations of the response and the
predictor and multiplies them by a factor of 2.5 (by default).  Hence
it is possible to define priors either in relative terms (by providing
a scaling factor) or in absolute terms, by providing the desired
priors along with the `autoscale = FALSE` _argument_.

The above prior summary tells us:

- for the intercept, it is using a normal prior with a mean of 164 and a
  standard deviation of 2.5.  This mean value is based on the mean of the
  response variable (rounded up).  The 2.5 is used for all intercepts.  The scale of the
  prior is then adjusted proportional to the variability in the response, by
  multiplying 2.5 by the standard deviation of the response (and rounding up).
  
```{r fitModel1c, results='markdown', eval=TRUE, mhidden=TRUE}
mean(fert$YIELD)
sd(fert$YIELD)
2.5*sd(fert$YIELD)
```

- for the coefficients (in this case, just the slope), the default prior is a
normal prior centred around 0 with a standard deviation of 2.5.  This is then
adjusted for the scale of the data by multiplying the 2.5 by the ratio of the
standard deviation of the response to the standard deviation of the predictor
(then rounded). 

```{r fitModel1d, results='markdown', eval=TRUE, mhidden=TRUE}
2.5*sd(fert$YIELD)/sd(fert$FERTILIZER)
```

-  the auxiliary prior represents whatever additional prior is required for the
   nominated model.  In the case of a Gaussian model, this will be $\sigma$, for
   negative binomial, it will be the reciprocal of dispersion, for gamma, it
   will be shape, etc .  By default in `rstanarm`, this
   is a exponential with a rate of 1 which is then adjusted by division with the
   standard deviation of the response.
   
```{r fitModel1e, results='markdown', eval=TRUE, mhidden=TRUE, cache=TRUE}
1/sd(fert$YIELD)
```

### Assessing priors

One way to assess the priors is to have the MCMC sampler sample purely from the
prior predictive distribution without conditioning on the observed data.  Doing
so provides a glimpse at the range of predictions possible under the priors.  On
the one hand, wide ranging predictions would ensure that the priors are unlikely
to influence the actual predictions once they are conditioned on the data.  On
the other hand, if they are too wide, the sampler is being permitted to traverse
into regions of parameter space that are not logically possible in the context
of the actual underlying ecological context.  Not only could this mean that
illogical parameter estimates are possible, when the sampler is traversing
regions of parameter space that are not supported by the actual data, the sampler
can become unstable and have difficulty.

We can draw from the prior predictive distribution instead of conditioning on
the response, by updating the model and indicating `prior_PD=TRUE`.  After
refitting the model in this way, we can plot the predictions to gain insights
into the range of predictions supported by the priors alone.

```{r fitModel1f, results='markdown', eval=TRUE, mhidden=TRUE, cache=TRUE}

**Conclusions:**

- we see that the range of predictions is fairly wide and the slope could range
  from strongly negative to strongly positive.
- at the same time, massive yields are not supported, so there is some
  constraints on the parameters space
- nevertheless, negative yields are considered possible, even though these are
  clearly not logical.

### Defining priors

The following link provides some guidance about defining priors.
[https://github.com/stan-dev/stan/wiki/Prior-Choice-Recommendations]

When defining our own priors, we typically do not want them to be scaled.

If we wanted to define our own priors that were less vague, yet still not likely
to bias the outcomes, we could try the following priors (mainly plucked out of
thin air):

- $\beta_0$: normal centred at 164 with a standard deviation of 65
- $\beta_1$: normal centred at 0 with a standard deviation of 2
- $\sigma$: half-t (df = 3) centred at 0 with a standard deviation of 65

We can visualise each of the above as:

```{r fitModel1h1, results='markdown', eval=TRUE, mhidden=TRUE, fig.width = 5, fig.height = 3}
standist::visualize("normal(164, 65)", xlim = c(0, 300)) +
standist::visualize("normal(0, 2)", xlim = c(-10, 10))
standist::visualize("student_t(3, 0, 65)",
                    "gamma(2,1)",
                    "exponential(0.016)",
                    xlim = c(-10, 50))

standist::visualize("student_t(3, 0, 65)",
                    "exponential(0.016)",
                    xlim = c(-10, 300))
```

I will also overlay the raw data for comparison.

```{r fitModel1h, results='markdown', eval=TRUE, mhidden=TRUE, cache=TRUE}
fert.rstanarm2= stan_glm(YIELD ~ FERTILIZER, data=fert,
                         prior_intercept = normal(164, 65, autoscale=FALSE),
                         prior = normal(0, 2, autoscale=FALSE),
                         prior_aux = student_t(3, 0, 65, autoscale=FALSE),
                         prior_PD=TRUE, 
                         iter = 5000, warmup = 1000,
                         chains = 3, cores = 3,
                         thin = 5, refresh = 0
                         )
```

```{r fitModel1i, results='markdown', eval=TRUE, mhidden=TRUE}
ggpredict(fert.rstanarm2) |>
  plot(add.data=TRUE)
```

Now lets refit, conditioning on the data.

```{r fitModel1j, results='markdown', eval=TRUE, mhidden=TRUE, cache=TRUE}
fert.rstanarm3= update(fert.rstanarm2,  prior_PD=FALSE)  
```

### Plotting prior and posterior

```{r modelFit1k, results='markdown', eval=TRUE, mhidden=TRUE, fig.width=6, fig.height=4}
posterior_vs_prior(fert.rstanarm3, color_by='vs', group_by=TRUE,
                   facet_args=list(scales='free_y'))
```

**Conclusions:**

- in each case, the prior is substantially wider than the posterior, suggesting
  that the posterior is not biased towards the prior.
  
```{r modelFit1l, results='markdown', eval=TRUE, mhidden=TRUE, fig.width=6, fig.height=4}
ggpredict(fert.rstanarm3) |> plot(add.data=TRUE)

## brms 
:::: {.panel-tabset}

https://mc-stan.org/cmdstanr/articles/cmdstanr.html
    
### Using default priors

In `brms`, the default priors are designed to be weakly informative.  They are
chosen to provide moderate regularisation (to help prevent over-fitting) and
help stabilise the computations.

Unlike `rstanarm`, `brms` models must be compiled before they start sampling.
For most models, the compilation of the stan code takes around 45 seconds.

```{r fitModel2a, results='markdown', eval=TRUE, mhidden=TRUE, cache=TRUE}
fert.brm <- brm(bf(YIELD ~ FERTILIZER),
               data = fert,
               iter = 5000,
               warmup = 1000,
               chains = 3,
               thin = 5,
               refresh = 0,
               backend = 'cmdstanr')
```

In the above:

- the formula and data arguments should be familiar as they are the same as for
  many models in R. That said, the formula specification of `brms` can define
  models that are not possible by most other routines. To facilitate this
  enhanced functionality, we usually define a `brms` formula within its own
  `bf()` function along with the `family` (in this case, it is Gaussian, which
  is the default and therefore can be omitted.)
- iter: indicates the number of MCMC iterations to perform per chain
- warmup: indicates how many of the initial MCMC samples to exclude.  During the
  warmup stage, the MCMC sampler is tuning its sampling operations to allow it
  to determine the best way to create the chain.  While it is in this discovery
  phase, the estimates it produces might be unrepresentative.
- chains: indicates the number of independent chains to run.  The more chains,
  the more random starts.  The point of multiple random starts is to minimise
  the potential for the starting point to dictate the outcome.  It is possible
  that a chain might get stuck sampling a single feature of the posterior and not discover
  additional features.  Additional random starting points should hopefully
  alleviate this. Either 3 or 4 is typical.
- thin: indicates the rate at which the MCMC samples should be thinned in order
  to eliminate auto-correlation between MCMC samples.  When the step lengths
  between MCMC samples are small, the resulting parameter estimates will be
  auto-correlated (since samples close by in the chain will be more similar than
  those far apart).  The rate of thinning necessary will depend on the degree
  of auto-correlation.  For stan models, a thinning rate of 5 is a good starting
  point.
- refresh: indicates how often the terminal display should be updated.  When
  running a large model, this can be useful as it provides a form of progress.
  However, when the routine is within an Rmarkdown document, it just results in
  the output including each line of progress and a lot of space is taken up unnecessarily

The returned object (a list) contains a range of objects.  The output
from `rstan` is contained in the `fit` list item.

```{r fitModel2a2, results='markdown', eval=TRUE, mhidden=TRUE}
fert.brm |> names()
```

Having allowed `brms` to formulate its own weakly informative priors, it is
a good idea to explore what they are.  Firstly, out of curiosity, it might be
interesting to see what it has chosen.  However, more importantly, we need to be
able to document what the priors were and the `brms` development team make
it very clear that there is no guarantee that the default priors will remain the
same into the future. 

```{r fitModel2b, results='markdown', eval=TRUE, mhidden=TRUE, paged.print=FALSE,tidy.opts = list(width.cutoff = 80), echo=2}
options(width=100)
prior_summary(fert.brm)
options(width=80)
```

This tells us:

- for the intercept, it is using a student t (flatter normal) prior with a mean of 161.5 and a
  standard deviation of 90.4.  These mean and standard deviation values are
  based on the median and median absolute deviation of the
  response variable (rounded).

**Note, all priors are on the link scale and on centered predictiors**

```{r fitModel2c, results='markdown', eval=TRUE, mhidden=TRUE}
median(fert$YIELD)
mad(fert$YIELD)
```

`mad` is the median absolute deviation.  `mad` is to `var` as `median`
is to `mean`.

```{r student_t_dist, results='markdown', eval=TRUE}
standist::visualize("student_t(3,161.5,90.4)", xlim=c(-100,1000))
```

- for the beta coefficients (in this case, just the slope), the
  default prior is a **improper flat prior**. A flat prior essentially
  means that any value between negative infinity and positive infinity
  are equally likely. Whilst this might seem reckless, in practice, it
  seems to work reasonably well for non-intercept beta parameters.

- the prior on sigma is also a student t (although only the positive
  half is used in the stan code), with mean of 0 and standard
  deviation of 90.4.
	  
```{r student_t_dist1, results='markdown', eval=TRUE}
standist::visualize("student_t(3,0,90.4)", xlim=c(-10,500))
```
	
### Assessing priors {.tabset .tabset-pills}

One way to assess the priors is to have the MCMC sampler sample purely
from the prior predictive distribution without conditioning on the
observed data.  Doing so provides a glimpse at the range of
predictions possible under the priors.  On the one hand, wide ranging
predictions would ensure that the priors are unlikely to influence the
actual predictions once they are conditioned on the data.  On the
other hand, if they are too wide, the sampler is being permitted to
traverse into regions of parameter space that are not logically
possible in the context of the actual underlying ecological context.
Not only could this mean that illogical parameter estimates are
possible, when the sampler is traversing regions of parameter space
that are not supported by the actual data, the sampler can become
unstable and have difficulty.

In `brms`, we can inform the sampler to draw from the prior predictive
distribution instead of conditioning on the response, by running the
model with the `sample_prior = 'only'` argument.  Unfortunately, this
cannot be applied when there are flat priors (since the posteriors
will necessarily extend to negative and positive infinity).
Therefore, in order to use this useful routine, we need to make sure
that we have defined a proper prior for all parameters.

Lets try a Gaussian (normal) distribution for the slope.  We will
start with what is likely to be a very wide distribution (wide with
respect to what we know about the likely slope).  `rstanarm` sets the
default for such population-level effects at 2.5 times the ratio of
standard deviations of the response and predictor.  The reason that
2.5 is used is that in a standard normal distribution, a standard
deviation of 2.5 encapsulates approximately 99% of the values.  Hence,
a standard deviation of 2.5 would represent reasonably wide
expectations (priors).  Given that the input data are unlikely to be
standardised, we can instead standardise the priors by multiplying the
2.5 by the ratio of standard deviations of the response and predictor.

We could adopt similar logic here, but rather than use standard
deviation, we could use median absolute deviation to be consistent
with other prior specifications in `brms`.  In this case, the prior
standard deviation would be `2.5 * mad(fert$YIELD)/mad(fert$FERTILIZER)` = `2.44` 
(which I will round to 2.5).

```{r normal_prior, results='markdown', eval=TRUE}
standist::visualize("normal(0, 2.5)", "student_t(3, 0, 2.5)", xlim = c(-50,50))
```

```{r fitModel2d, results='markdown', eval=TRUE, mhidden=TRUE, cache=TRUE}
fert.brm1 <- brm(bf(YIELD ~ FERTILIZER),
                 data = fert,

                 sample_prior = 'only', 
                 iter = 5000,
                 warmup = 1000,
                 chains = 3,
                 thin = 5,
                 backend = 'cmdstanr',
                 refresh = 0)

When defining our own priors, we typically do not want them to be scaled.

If we wanted to define our own priors that were less vague, yet still
not likely to bias the outcomes, we could try the following priors
(which I have mainly plucked out of thin air):

- $\beta_0$: normal centred at 164 with a standard deviation of 65
  - mean of 164: since `median(fert$YIELD)`
  - sd pf 65: since `mad(fert$YIELD)`
- $\beta_1$: normal centred at 0 with a standard deviation of 2.5
  - sd of 2.5: since `2.5*(mad(fert$YIELD)/mad(fert$FERTILIZER))`
- $\sigma$: half-t centred at 0 with a standard deviation of 65 OR
  - sd pf 65: since `mad(fert$YIELD)`
- $\sigma$: gamma with shape parameters of 2 and 1


```{r priors, results='markdown', eval=TRUE}

### Plotting prior and posterior

When we have indicated that the posterior should be informed by both
the prior and the posterior, both prior (governed by priors alone) and
posterior (governed by both priors and data/likelihood) draws are
returned.  These can be compared by exploring the probabilities
associated with specific hypotheses - the most obvious of which is
that of no effect (that the parameter = 0).

When doing so, ideally the posterior should be distinct from the
prior.  If this is not the case, it might suggest that the posteriors
are being too strongly driven by the priors.

```{r posterior2, results='markdown', eval=TRUE}
fert.brm3 |> get_variables()
## fert.brm3 |> hypothesis('Intercept=0', class='b') |> plot
fert.brm3 |> hypothesis('FERTILIZER = 0') |> plot()
## fert.brm3 |> hypothesis('scaleFERTILIZERscaleEQFALSE=0') |> plot
fert.brm3 |> hypothesis('sigma = 0', class = '') |> plot()
```

Unfortunately, it is not possible to do this comparison sensibly for
the intercept.  The reason for this is that the prior for intercept
was applied to an intercept that is associated with centred
continuous predictors (predictors are centred behind the scenes).
Since we did not centre the predictor, the intercept returned is as if
uncentred.  Hence, the prior and posterior are on different scales.
 
```{r fitModel2k, results='markdown', eval=TRUE, mhidden=TRUE, fig.width = 8, fig.height = 4}
fert.brm3 |> get_variables()
fert.brm3 |> SUYR_prior_and_posterior()
```

```

## INLA 
:::: {.panel-tabset}

```{r INLApackages, results='markdown', eval=TRUE}
library(INLA)
```

### Using default priors

In `INLA`, the default priors are designed to be diffuse or weak.  They are
chosen to provide moderate regularisation (to help prevent over-fitting) and
help stabilise the computations.


** Note as of mid 2022, the INLA developers have intentionally
disabled the calculation of marginals in order to make the models
faster**. Unfortunately, this prevents the calculation of residuals
from the `INLAutils` package. So I will turn them on... More info can be viewed here
https://groups.google.com/g/r-inla-discussion-group/c/2E9z3QfmeXw/m/XB0PoLqEBAAJ?pli=1

```{r fitModel3a, results='markdown', eval=TRUE, mhidden=TRUE}
fert.inla <- inla(YIELD ~ FERTILIZER,
                  data = fert,
                  family = 'gaussian',
                  control.predictor =  list(compute = TRUE, link =  1),
                  control.compute = list(config = TRUE,
                    dic = TRUE, waic = TRUE, cpo = TRUE,
                    return.marginals.predictor=TRUE
                    )
                  )
```

In the above:

- the `formula`, `data` and `family` arguments should be familiar as they are the same as for 
  other models in R.
- `control.compute`: allows us to indicate what additional actions
  should be performed during the model fitting.  In this case, we have indicated:
  
  - `dic`: Deviance information criterion
  - `waic`: Wantanabe information creterion
  - `cpo`: out-of-sample estimates (measures of fit)
  - `config`: return the full configuration - to allow drawing from the posterior. 


```{r fitModel3a2, results='markdown', eval=TRUE, mhidden=TRUE}
fert.inla |> names()
```

Having allowed `INLA` to formulate its own "minimally informative"
priors, it is a good idea to explore what they are.  Firstly, out of
curiosity, it might be interesting to see what it has chosen.
However, more importantly, we need to be able to document what the
priors were and the `INLA` development team make it very clear that
there is no guarantee that the default priors will remain the same
into the future.

In calcutating the posterior mode of hyperparameters, it is efficient
to maximising the sum of the (log)-likelihood and the (log)-prior,
hence, priors are defined on a log-scale.  The canonical prior for
variance is the _gamma_ prior, hence in `INLA`, this is a _loggamma_.

They are also defined according to their mean and **precision**
(_inverse-scale_, rather than variance).  Precision is $1/\sigma$.

To explore the default priors used by `INLA`, we can issue the
following on the fitted model:

```{r fitModel3b0, results='markdown', eval=TRUE, mhidden=TRUE, paged.print=FALSE,tidy.opts = list(width.cutoff = 80), echo=TRUE}
inla.priors.used(fert.inla)
```

The above indicates:

- the prior on the overal family (log) precision ($1/sigma$) is a
  log-gamma with shape of 1 and scale of 0.00005.  Since this is a
  log-gamma on log-precision, it is equivalent to a gamma (shape =
  $1$, scale = $10^-5$) on precision.  Such a distribution is very
  wide and has a mean of ($shape/scale =$ `r 1/0.00005`) and variance of
  ($shape/scale^2 =$ `r 1/(0.00005)^2`).
  
```{r fitModel3b3, results='markdown', eval=TRUE, mhidden=TRUE, paged.print=FALSE,tidy.opts = list(width.cutoff = 80)}
standist::visualize("gamma(1, 0.00005)", xlim=c(-100,100000))
```

- the prior on the intercept is a Gaussian (normal) distribution with
  mean of 0 and precision of 0 - this is effectively a uniform
  distribution from $-\infty$ to $\infty$.
- the prior on the slope is a Gaussian (normal) distribution with a
  mean of 0 and a precision of 0.001 (which equates to a standard
  deviation of $(1/0.001)^{0.5}$=`r sqrt(1/0.001)`.  This is also a
  very wide distribution (consider what a slope large in magnitude of
  100 means in the context of the rate of grass yield increase per
  unit increase in fertiliser concentration).

```{r fitModel3b1, results='markdown', eval=TRUE, mhidden=TRUE, paged.print=FALSE,tidy.opts = list(width.cutoff = 80)}
standist::visualize("normal(0, 31)", xlim=c(-100,100))
```

### Defining own priors

**Family variance**

In order to drive the specification of weekly informative priors for
variance components (a prior that allows the data to dictate the
parameter estimates whilst constraining the range of the marginal
distribution within sensible bounds), we can consider the range over
which the marginal distribution of variance components would be
sensible. For the range [-R,R], the equivalent gamma parameters:

$$
\begin{align}
a &= \frac{d}{2}\\
b &= \frac{R^2d}{2*(t^d_{1-(1-q)/2})^2}
\end{align}
$$

where $d$ is the degrees of freedom (for Cauchy marginal, $d=1$) and
$t^d_{1-(1-q)/2}$ is the $q_{th}$ quantile of a Student t with $d$
degrees of freedom. Hence if we considered variance likely to be in
the range of [0,100], we could define a loggamma prior of:

$$
\begin{align}			
a &= \frac{1}{2} = 0.5\\
b &= \frac{100^2}{2*161.447} = 30.9\\
\tau &\sim{} log\Gamma(0.5,30.9)
\end{align}
$$


```{r fitModel3b5, results='markdown', eval=TRUE, mhidden=TRUE, paged.print=FALSE,tidy.opts = list(width.cutoff = 80)}
standist::visualize("gamma(0.5, 0.032)", xlim=c(-5,100))
```

**Intercept**

The default prior on the intercept is a Gaussian with mean of 0 and
precision of 0 (and thus effectively a flat uniform).  Alternatively,
we could define priors on the intercept that are more realistic.  For
example, we know that the median grass yield is `r min(fert$YIELD)`.
Hence, the intercept is likely to be relatively close to this value.
Note, arguably it would be more sensible to center the predictor
variable (fertiliser concentration) so that the intercept would
represent the yeild at the average fertiliser concentration.
Furthermore, this would also be more computationally expedient. In
fact, the only reason we are not doing so is so that we can directly
compare the parameter estimates to the frequentist linear model.

```{r fitModel3b9, results='markdown', eval=TRUE, mhidden=TRUE, paged.print=FALSE,tidy.opts = list(width.cutoff = 80)}
min(fert$YIELD)
median(fert$YIELD)
mad(fert$YIELD)
```

We will multiply the variability (`r mad(fert$YIELD)`) by 3 so as to
estimate an envelope that so as to fully capture the full range of
expected values (`r 3*mad(fert$YIELD)`.

```{r fitModel3b8, results='markdown', eval=TRUE, mhidden=TRUE, paged.print=FALSE,tidy.opts = list(width.cutoff = 80)}
standist::visualize("normal(80, 271.32)", xlim=c(-700,1000))
```
 
We could use these values as the basis for weekly informative priors
on the intercept.  Note, as `INLA` priors are expressed in terms of
precision rather than variance, an equvilent prior would be
$\sim{}~\mathcal{N}(80, 0.00001)$ (e.g. $1/(MAD\times 3)^2$).


**Fixed effects**

The priors for the fixed effects (slope) is a Gaussian (normal)
distributions with mean of 0 and precision (0.001). This implies that
the prior for slope has a standard deviation of approximately 31
(since $\sigma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{\tau}}$). As a general rule, three
standard deviations envelopes most of a distribution, and thus this
prior defines a distribution whose density is almost entirely within
the range [-93,93]. Arguably, this is very wide for the slope given
the range of the predictor variable.

In order to generate realistic informative Gaussian priors (for the
purpose of constraining the posterior to a logical range) for fixed
parameters, the following formulae are useful:

$$
\begin{align}
\mu &= \frac{z_2\theta_1 - z_1\theta_2}{z_2-z_1}\\
\sigma &= \frac{\theta_2 - \theta_1}{z_2-z_1}
\end{align}
$$

where $\theta_1$ and $\theta_2$ are the quantiles on the response
scale and $z_1$ and $z_2$ are the corresponding quantiles on the
standard normal scale. Hence, if we considered that the slope is
likely to be in the range of [-10,10], we could specify a Normal prior
with mean of $\mu=\frac{(qnorm(0.5,0,1)*0) - (qnorm(0.975,0,1)*10)}{10-0} = 0$ 
and a standard deviation of $\sigma^2=\frac{10 - 0}{qnorm(0.975,0,1)-qnorm(0.5,0,1)} = 5.102$.
In INLA (which defines priors in terms of precision rather than standard deviation), 
the associated prior would be $\beta \sim{} \mathcal{N}(0, 0.0384)$.


```{r fitModel3b4, results='markdown', eval=TRUE, mhidden=TRUE, paged.print=FALSE,tidy.opts = list(width.cutoff = 80)}
standist::visualize("normal(0, 5.102)", xlim=c(-20,20))
```

In order to define each of the above priors, we could modify the `inla` call:


```{r fitModel3b6, results='markdown', eval=TRUE, mhidden=TRUE}
fert.inla1 <- inla(YIELD ~ FERTILIZER,
                  data = fert,
                  family = 'gaussian',
                  control.fixed = list(
                      mean.intercept = 80,
                      prec.intercept = 0.00001,
                      mean = 0,
                      prec = 0.0384),
                  control.predictor =  list(compute = TRUE, link =  1),
                  control.family = list(hyper = list(prec = list(prior = "loggamma",
                                                                param = c(0.5, 0.032)))),
                  control.compute = list(config = TRUE,
                    return.marginals.predictor=TRUE,
                    dic = TRUE,
                    waic = TRUE,
                    cpo = TRUE)
                  ) 
```

Lets briefly compare the parameter estimates. In the following,
`Model.1` is the model that employed the default priors and `Model.2`
is the model that employed the user defined priors.

```{r fitModel3b7, results='markdown', eval=TRUE, mhidden=TRUE}
## Fixed effects
rbind(Model.1 = fert.inla$summary.fixed, Model.2 = fert.inla1$summary.fixed)

## Family hyperpriors (variance)
rbind(Model.1 = fert.inla$summary.hyperpar, Model.2 = fert.inla1$summary.hyperpar)
```

It is clear that the two models yeild very similar parameter estimates.

### Plotting prior vs posterior

Note, the following will not appear in this tutorial as 
the INLA plotting function has been really awkwardly written
and is not compatible with Rmd.

```{r fitModel3d0, results='markdown', eval=TRUE, mhidden=TRUE}
plot(fert.inla1,
     plot.fixed.effects = TRUE,
     plot.lincomb = FALSE,
     plot.random.effects = FALSE,
     plot.hyperparameters = TRUE,
     plot.predictor = FALSE,
     plot.q = FALSE,
     plot.cpo = FALSE,
     plot.prior = TRUE,
     single = FALSE)
```

```{r fitModel3d1, results='markdown', eval=TRUE, mhidden=TRUE, fig.width = 6, fig.height = 3}
plot_fixed_marginals(fert.inla1, priors = TRUE)
```
```{r fitModel3d1a, results='markdown', eval=TRUE, mhidden=TRUE, fig.width = 3, fig.height = 3}
library(INLAutils)
plot_hyper_marginals(fert.inla1, CI = TRUE)
```
Or the effects as a single figure..

```{r fitModel3d1c, results='markdown', eval=TRUE, mhidden=TRUE, fig.width = 6, fig.height = 6}
library(INLAutils)
autoplot(fert.inla1)
```

```{r fitModel3d2, results='markdown', eval=TRUE, mhidden=TRUE, fig.width=8}
marg.fix <- fert.inla1$marginals.fixed
(nm <- names(marg.fix))
p <- vector('list', length(nm))
for (wch in 1:length(nm)) {
    xy <- INLA:::inla.get.prior.xy(section = 'fixed', hyperid = nm[1] ,
                                   all.hyper = fert.inla1$all.hyper,
                                   range = 3*range(marg.fix[[wch]][,'x']))
    p[[wch]] <- ggplot() +
        geom_density(data=as.data.frame(marg.fix[[wch]]),
                     aes(x=x, y=y, fill='Posterior'), alpha=0.2,
                     stat='Identity') +
        geom_density(data=as.data.frame(xy), aes(x=x, y=y, fill='Prior'), alpha = 0.2,
                     stat='Identity')
}

# MCMC sampling diagnostics 

**MCMC sampling behaviour**

Since the purpose of the MCMC sampling is to estimate the posterior of
an unknown joint likelihood, it is important that we explore a range
of diagnostics designed to help identify when the resulting likelihood
might not be accurate.

- **traceplots** - plots of the individual draws in sequence.  Traces
  that resemble noise suggest that all likelihood features are likely
  to have be traversed. Obvious steps or blocks of noise are likely to
  represent distinct features and could imply that there are yet other
  features that have not yet been traversed - necessitating additional
  iterations.  Furthermore, each chain should be indistinguishable
  from the others
- **autocorrelation function** - plots of the degree of correlation
  between pairs of draws for a range of lags (distance along the
  chains).  High levels of correlation (after a lag of 0, which is
  correlating each draw with itself) suggests a lack of independence
  between the draws and that therefore, summaries such as mean and
  median will be biased estimates.  Ideally, all non-zero lag
  correlations should be less than 0.2.
- **convergence diagnostics** - there are a range of diagnostics aimed
  at exploring whether the multiple chains are likely to have
  converged upon similar posteriors
  - **R hat** - this metric compares between and within chain model
    parameter estimates, with the expectation that if the chains have
    converged, the between and within rank normalised estimates should
    be very similar (and Rhat should be close to 1).  The more one
    chains deviates from the others, the higher the Rhat value.
    Values less than 1.05 are considered evidence of convergence.
  - **Bulk ESS** - this is a measure of the effective sample size
    from the whole (bulk) of the posterior and is a good measure of
    the sampling efficiency of draws across the entire posterior
  - **Tail ESS** - this is a measure of the effective sample size from
    the 5% and 95% quantiles (tails) of the posterior and is a good
    measure of the sampling efficiency of draws from the tail (areas
    of the posterior with least support and where samplers can get
    stuck).

<!-- START_PRIVATE-->

In addition to the regular model diagnostics checking, for Bayesian analyses, it
is also necessary to explore the MCMC sampling diagnostics to be sure that the
chains are well mixed and have converged on a stable posterior.

There are a wide variety of tests that range from the big picture, overall chain
characteristics to the very specific detailed tests that allow the experienced
modeller to drill down to the very fine details of the chain behaviour.
Furthermore, there are a multitude of packages and approaches for exploring
these diagnostics.

::: {.panel-tabset}
## rstanarm 

:::: {.panel-tabset}
### bayesplot

The `bayesplot` package offers a range of MCMC diagnostics as well as Posterior
Probability Checks (PPC), all of which have a convenient `plot()` interface.
Lets start with the MCMC diagnostics.

```{r modelValidation1a, results='markdown', eval=TRUE, mhidden=TRUE, fig.width=6, fig.height=4}
available_mcmc()
```

Of these, we will focus on:

- mcmc_trace: this plots the estimates of each parameter over the post-warmup
  length of each MCMC chain.  Each chain is plotted in a different shade of
  blue, with each parameter in its own facet.  Ideally, each **trace** should
  just look like noise without any discernible drift and each of the traces for
  a specific parameter should look the same (i.e, should not be displaced above
  or below any other trace for that parameter).

```{r modelValidation1b, results='markdown', eval=TRUE, mhidden=TRUE, fig.width=6, fig.height=4}
plot(fert.rstanarm3, plotfun='mcmc_trace')
```
   
   The chains appear well mixed and very similar
   
- acf (autocorrelation function): plots the autocorrelation between successive
  MCMC sample lags for each parameter and each chain
  
```{r modelValidation1c, results='markdown', eval=TRUE, mhidden=TRUE, fig.width=6, fig.height=4}
plot(fert.rstanarm3, 'acf_bar')
```

   There is no evidence of autocorrelation in the MCMC samples

- Rhat: Rhat is a measure of convergence between the chains.  The closer the
  values are to 1, the more the chains have converged.  Values greater than 1.05
  indicate a lack of convergence.  There will be an Rhat value for each
  parameter estimated.

```{r modelValidation1d, results='markdown', eval=TRUE, mhidden=TRUE, fig.width=6, fig.height=4}
plot(fert.rstanarm3, 'rhat_hist')
```

  All Rhat values are below 1.05, suggesting the chains have converged.
  
- neff (number of effective samples): the ratio of the number of effective
  samples (those not rejected by the sampler) to the number of samples provides
  an indication of the effectiveness (and efficiency) of the MCMC sampler.
  Ratios that are less than 0.5 for a parameter suggest that the sampler spent
  considerable time in difficult areas of the sampling domain and rejected more
  than half of the samples (replacing them with the previous effective sample).  
  
  If the ratios are low, tightening the priors may help.
  
```{r modelValidation1e, results='markdown', eval=TRUE, mhidden=TRUE, fig.width=6, fig.height=4}
plot(fert.rstanarm3, 'neff_hist')
```

  Ratios all very high.

### stan plots

The `rstan` package offers a range of MCMC diagnostics.
Lets start with the MCMC diagnostics.

Of these, we will focus on:

- stan_trace: this plots the estimates of each parameter over the post-warmup
  length of each MCMC chain. Each chain is plotted in a different colour, with
  each parameter in its own facet. Ideally, each **trace** should just look like
  noise without any discernible drift and each of the traces for a specific
  parameter should look the same (i.e, should not be displaced above or below
  any other trace for that parameter).
  
```{r modelValidation1g, results='markdown', eval=TRUE, mhidden=TRUE, fig.width=6, fig.height=4}
stan_trace(fert.rstanarm3)
```

   The chains appear well mixed and very similar
   
- stan_acf (autocorrelation function): plots the autocorrelation between successive
  MCMC sample lags for each parameter and each chain
  
```{r modelValidation1h, results='markdown', eval=TRUE, mhidden=TRUE, fig.width=6, fig.height=4}
stan_ac(fert.rstanarm3) 
```

   There is no evidence of autocorrelation in the MCMC samples

- stan_rhat: Rhat is a **scale reduction factor** measure of convergence between the chains.  The closer the
  values are to 1, the more the chains have converged.  Values greater than 1.05
  indicate a lack of convergence.  There will be an Rhat value for each
  parameter estimated.

```{r modelValidation1i, results='markdown', eval=TRUE, mhidden=TRUE, fig.width=6, fig.height=4}
stan_rhat(fert.rstanarm3) 
```

  All Rhat values are below 1.05, suggesting the chains have converged.
  
- stan_ess (number of effective samples): the ratio of the number of effective
  samples (those not rejected by the sampler) to the number of samples provides
  an indication of the effectiveness (and efficiency) of the MCMC sampler.
  Ratios that are less than 0.5 for a parameter suggest that the sampler spent
  considerable time in difficult areas of the sampling domain and rejected more
  than half of the samples (replacing them with the previous effective sample).  
  
  If the ratios are low, tightening the priors may help.
  
```{r modelValidation1j, results='markdown', eval=TRUE, mhidden=TRUE, fig.width=6, fig.height=4}
stan_ess(fert.rstanarm3)
```

  Ratios all very high.

```{r modelValidation1k, results='markdown', eval=TRUE, mhidden=TRUE, fig.width=6, fig.height=4}
stan_dens(fert.rstanarm3, separate_chains = TRUE)
```

### ggmcmc

The `ggmean` package also has a set of MCMC diagnostic functions.
Lets start with the MCMC diagnostics.

Of these, we will focus on:

- ggs_traceplot: this plots the estimates of each parameter over the post-warmup
  length of each MCMC chain. Each chain is plotted in a different colour, with
  each parameter in its own facet. Ideally, each **trace** should just look like
  noise without any discernible drift and each of the traces for a specific
  parameter should look the same (i.e, should not be displaced above or below
  any other trace for that parameter).

```{r modelValidation1l, results='markdown', eval=TRUE, mhidden=TRUE, fig.width=6, fig.height=9}
fert.ggs <- ggs(fert.rstanarm3)
ggs_traceplot(fert.ggs)
```

   The chains appear well mixed and very similar
   
- gss_autocorrelation (autocorrelation function): plots the autocorrelation between successive
  MCMC sample lags for each parameter and each chain
  
```{r modelValidation1m, results='markdown', eval=TRUE, mhidden=TRUE, fig.width=6, fig.height=4}
ggs_autocorrelation(fert.ggs)
```

   There is no evidence of autocorrelation in the MCMC samples

- stan_rhat: Rhat is a **scale reduction factor** measure of convergence between the chains.  The closer the
  values are to 1, the more the chains have converged.  Values greater than 1.05
  indicate a lack of convergence.  There will be an Rhat value for each
  parameter estimated.

```{r modelValidation1n, results='markdown', eval=TRUE, mhidden=TRUE, fig.width=6, fig.height=4}

  All Rhat values are below 1.05, suggesting the chains have converged.
  
- stan_ess (number of effective samples): the ratio of the number of effective
  samples (those not rejected by the sampler) to the number of samples provides

```

  The chains appear well mixed and very similar
   
- acf_bar (autocorrelation function): plots the autocorrelation
  between successive MCMC sample lags for each parameter and each
  chain
  
```{r modelValidation2c, results='markdown', eval=TRUE, mhidden=TRUE, fig.width=6, fig.height=4}
fert.brm3 |> mcmc_plot(type = 'acf_bar')

There is no evidence of autocorrelation in the MCMC samples

- rhat_hist: Rhat is a **scale reduction factor** measure of

  more the chains have converged.  Values greater than 1.05 indicate a

```{r modelValidation2g, results='markdown', eval=TRUE, mhidden=TRUE, fig.width=6, fig.height=4}
stan_trace(fert.brm3$fit)
fert.brm3$fit |> stan_trace()
fert.brm3$fit |> stan_trace(inc_warmup = TRUE)
```

   The chains appear well mixed and very similar
   
- stan_acf (autocorrelation function): plots the autocorrelation between successive
  MCMC sample lags for each parameter and each chain
  
```{r modelValidation2h, results='markdown', eval=TRUE, mhidden=TRUE, fig.width=6, fig.height=4}
fert.brm3$fit |> stan_ac() 
```

   There is no evidence of autocorrelation in the MCMC samples

- stan_rhat: Rhat is a **scale reduction factor** measure of convergence between the chains.  The closer the
  values are to 1, the more the chains have converged.  Values greater than 1.05
  indicate a lack of convergence.  There will be an Rhat value for each
  parameter estimated.

```{r modelValidation2i, results='markdown', eval=TRUE, mhidden=TRUE, fig.width=6, fig.height=4}
fert.brm3$fit |> stan_rhat() 
```

  All Rhat values are below 1.05, suggesting the chains have converged.
  
- stan_ess (number of effective samples): the ratio of the number of effective
  samples (those not rejected by the sampler) to the number of samples provides
  an indication of the effectiveness (and efficiency) of the MCMC sampler.
  Ratios that are less than 0.5 for a parameter suggest that the sampler spent
  considerable time in difficult areas of the sampling domain and rejected more
  than half of the samples (replacing them with the previous effective sample).  
  
  If the ratios are low, tightening the priors may help.
  
```{r modelValidation2j, results='markdown', eval=TRUE, mhidden=TRUE, fig.width=6, fig.height=4}
fert.brm3$fit |> stan_ess()
```

  Ratios all very high.

```{r modelValidation2k, results='markdown', eval=TRUE, mhidden=TRUE, fig.width=6, fig.height=4}
fert.brm3$fit |> stan_dens(separate_chains = TRUE)
```

### ggmcmc

The `ggmcmc` package also has a set of MCMC diagnostic functions.
Lets start with the MCMC diagnostics.

Of these, we will focus on:

- ggs_traceplot: this plots the estimates of each parameter over the post-warmup
  length of each MCMC chain. Each chain is plotted in a different colour, with
  each parameter in its own facet. Ideally, each **trace** should just look like
  noise without any discernible drift and each of the traces for a specific
  parameter should look the same (i.e, should not be displaced above or below
  any other trace for that parameter).

```{r modelValidation2l, results='markdown', eval=TRUE, mhidden=TRUE, fig.width=6, fig.height=7}
fert.ggs <- fert.brm3$fit |> ggs(inc_warmup = TRUE, burnin = TRUE)  # does not seem to ignore burnin?
fert.ggs |> ggs_traceplot()
fert.ggs <- fert.brm3$fit |> ggs(inc_warmup = FALSE, burnin = TRUE)  # does not seem to ignore burnin?
fert.ggs |> ggs_traceplot()
```

   The chains appear well mixed and very similar
   
- gss_autocorrelation (autocorrelation function): plots the autocorrelation between successive
  MCMC sample lags for each parameter and each chain
  
```{r modelValidation2m, results='markdown', eval=TRUE, mhidden=TRUE, fig.width=6, fig.height=7}
fert.ggs |> ggs_autocorrelation()
```

   There is no evidence of autocorrelation in the MCMC samples

- stan_rhat: Rhat is a **scale reduction factor** measure of convergence between the chains.  The closer the
  values are to 1, the more the chains have converged.  Values greater than 1.05
  indicate a lack of convergence.  There will be an Rhat value for each
  parameter estimated.

```{r modelValidation2n, results='markdown', eval=TRUE, mhidden=TRUE, fig.width=6, fig.height=4}
fert.ggs |> ggs_Rhat()
```

  All Rhat values are below 1.05, suggesting the chains have converged.
  
- stan_ess (number of effective samples): the ratio of the number of effective
  samples (those not rejected by the sampler) to the number of samples provides
  an indication of the effectiveness (and efficiency) of the MCMC sampler.
  Ratios that are less than 0.5 for a parameter suggest that the sampler spent
  considerable time in difficult areas of the sampling domain and rejected more
  than half of the samples (replacing them with the previous effective sample).  
  
  If the ratios are low, tightening the priors may help.
  
```{r modelValidation2o, results='markdown', eval=TRUE, mhidden=TRUE, fig.width=6, fig.height=4}
fert.ggs |> ggs_effective()
```

  Ratios all very high.

<details><summary>More diagnostics</summary>

## INLA

The sampling diagnostics are not relevant to INLA.
Instead, we can focus on CPO and PIT

```{r fitModel3d1b, results='markdown', eval=TRUE, mhidden=TRUE, fig.width = 6, fig.height = 6}
fert.inla1.cpo <- data.frame(cpo = fert.inla1$cpo$cpo,
           pit = fert.inla1$cpo$pit,
           failure = fert.inla1$cpo$failure) |>
    filter(failure == 0) |>
    mutate(row = 1:n())

g1 <- fert.inla1.cpo |>
    ggplot(aes(y = cpo, x = row)) +
    geom_point()
g2 <- fert.inla1.cpo |>
    ggplot(aes(x = cpo)) +
    geom_histogram()
g3 <- fert.inla1.cpo |>
    ggplot(aes(y = pit, x = row)) +
    geom_point()
g4 <- fert.inla1.cpo |>
    ggplot(aes(x = pit)) +
    geom_histogram()

(g1 + g2)/(g3 + g4)
```

Ideally, we want to see that no CPO or PIT is very different in value
from any others (not the case here) and that the histograms are
relatively flat (which they kind of are here - particularly
considering the small amount of data).

### pp check
Post predictive checks provide additional diagnostics about the fit of the
model.  Specifically, they provide a comparison between predictions drawn from
the model and the observed data used to train the model.

```{r modelValidation3a, results='markdown', eval=TRUE, mhidden=TRUE, fig.width=6, fig.height=4}
available_ppc()
```

- dens_overlay: plots the density distribution of the observed data (black line)
overlayed on top of 50 density distributions generated from draws from the model
(light blue).  Ideally, the 50 realisations should be roughly consistent with
the observed data. 

```{r modelValidation3b, results='markdown', eval=TRUE, mhidden=TRUE, fig.width=6, fig.height=4}
pp_check(fert.rstanarm3,  plotfun='dens_overlay')
```
The model draws appear to be consistent with the observed data.

- error_scatter_avg: this plots the observed values against the average
  residuals. Similar to a residual plot, we do not want to see any patterns in
  this plot

```{r modelValidation3c, results='markdown', eval=TRUE, mhidden=TRUE, fig.width=6, fig.height=4}
pp_check(fert.rstanarm3, plotfun='error_scatter_avg')
```

There is no obvious pattern in the residuals.

- error_scatter_avg_vs_x: this is similar to a regular residual plot and as such
  should be interpreted as such.

```{r modelValidation3d, results='markdown', eval=TRUE, mhidden=TRUE, fig.width=6, fig.height=4}
pp_check(fert.rstanarm3, x=fert$FERTILIZER, plotfun='error_scatter_avg_vs_x')
```

- intervals:  plots the observed data overlayed onto of posterior predictions
associated with each level of the predictor.  Ideally, the observed data should
all fall within the predictive intervals.


```{r modelValidation3e, results='markdown', eval=TRUE, mhidden=TRUE, fig.width=6, fig.height=4}
pp_check(fert.rstanarm3, x=fert$FERTILIZER, plotfun='intervals')
```

- ribbon: this is just an alternative way of expressing the above plot.

```{r modelValidation3f, results='markdown', eval=TRUE, mhidden=TRUE, fig.width=6, fig.height=4}
pp_check(fert.rstanarm3, x=fert$FERTILIZER,plotfun='ribbon')
```

The `shinystan` package allows the full suite of MCMC diagnostics and posterior
predictive checks to be accessed via a web interface.

```{r modelValidation3g, results='markdown', eval=TRUE, mhidden=TRUE, fig.width=6, fig.height=4}
#library(shinystan)
#launch_shinystan(fert.rstanarm3)

### DHARMa residuals

DHARMa residuals provide very useful diagnostics.  Unfortunately, we cannot
directly use the `simulateResiduals()` function to generate the simulated
residuals.  However, if we are willing to calculate some of the components
yourself, we can still obtain the simulated residuals from the fitted stan model.

We need to supply:

- simulated (predicted) responses associated with each observation.
- observed values
- fitted (predicted) responses (averaged) associated with each observation

```{r modelValidation4a, results='markdown', eval=TRUE, mhidden=TRUE, fig.width=8, fig.height=5}
preds <- posterior_predict(fert.rstanarm3,  ndraws=250,  summary=FALSE)
fert.resids <- createDHARMa(simulatedResponse = t(preds),
                            observedResponse = fert$YIELD,
                            fittedPredictedResponse = apply(preds, 2, median),
                            integerResponse = 'gaussian')
plot(fert.resids)
```

**Conclusions:**

- the simulated residuals do not suggest any issues with the residuals
- there is no evidence of a lack of fit.

fert.resids <- createDHARMa(simulatedResponse = t(preds),
                            observedResponse = fert$YIELD,
                            fittedPredictedResponse = apply(preds, 2, median),
                            integerResponse = FALSE)
fert.resids |> plot()
```

```{r modelValidation6aa, results='markdown', eval=TRUE, mhidden=TRUE, fig.width=8, fig.height=10}

fert.resids <- make_brms_dharma_res(fert.brm3, integerResponse = FALSE)
wrap_elements(~testUniformity(fert.resids)) +
               wrap_elements(~plotResiduals(fert.resids, form = factor(rep(1, nrow(fert))))) +
               wrap_elements(~plotResiduals(fert.resids)) +
               wrap_elements(~testDispersion(fert.resids))

```

The `integerResponse` argument indicates that noise will be added to
the residuals such that they will become integers.  This is important
in for Poisson, Negative Binomial and Binomial models.

**Conclusions:**

- the simulated residuals do not suggest any issues with the residuals
- there is no evidence of a lack of fit.

## INLA
:::: {.panel-tabset}

### Out-of-sample performance

`INLA` includes two measures of out-of-sample performace (measures of
fit). 

- **Conditional Predictive Ordinate (CPO)** is the density of the
  observed value of $y_i$ within the out-of-sample ($y−i$) posterior
  predictive distribution. A small CPO value associated with an
  observation suggests that this observation is unlikely (or
  surprising) in light of the model, priors and other data in the
  model. In addition, the sum of the CPO values (or alternatively, the
  negative of the mean natural logarithm of the CPO values) is a
  measure of fit.
  ```{r fitModel3e0, results='markdown', eval=TRUE, mhidden=TRUE}
  fert.inla1$cpo$cpo
  sum(fert.inla1$cpo$cop)
  -mean(log(fert.inla1$cpo$cpo))
  ```
  In this case there are no CPO values that are considerably smaller
  (order of magnitude smaller) than the others - so with respect to
  the model, none of the observed values would be considered
  'surprising'. Various assumptions are made behind INLA's
  computations. If any of these assumptions fail for an observation,
  it is flagged within (in this case) `cpo$failure` as a
  non-zero. When this is the case, it is prudent to recalculate the
  CPO values after removing the observations associated with failure
  flags not equal to zero and re-fitting the model. This can be
  performed using the `inla.cpo()` function.
  ```{r fitModel3e1, results='markdown', eval=TRUE, mhidden=TRUE}
  fert.inla1$cpo$failure
  ```
  In this case, there are no non-zero CPO values.

- **Probability Integral Transforms (PIT)** provides a version of CPO
  that is calibrated to the level of the Gaussian field so that it is
  clearer whether or not any of the values are 'small' (all values
  must be between 0 and 1). A histogram of PIT values that does not
  look approximately uniform (flat) indicates a lack of model fit.
  
  Unfortunately, the following will not work inside of an Rmarkdown
  (but will work fine on the console)
  
```{r fitModel3e3, results='markdown', eval=TRUE, hidden=FALSE}
  plot(fert.inla1,
       plot.fixed.effects = FALSE,
       plot.lincomb = FALSE,
       plot.random.effects = FALSE,
       plot.hyperparameters = FALSE,
       plot.predictor = FALSE,
       plot.q = FALSE,
       plot.cpo = TRUE,
       plot.prior = FALSE) 
```
  In this case the PIT values do not appear to deviate from a uniform
  distribution and thus do not indicate a lack of fit.

```{r fitModel3d1b, results='markdown', eval=TRUE, mhidden=TRUE, fig.width = 6, fig.height = 6}
```

Ideally, we want to see that no CPO or PIT is very different in value
from any others (not the case here) and that the histograms are
relatively flat (which they kind of are here - particularly
considering the small amount of data).

In the following, the top left is the distribution of residuals and
top right is the observed vs predicted values.

```{r fitModel3e4, results='markdown', eval=TRUE, mhidden=TRUE}
ggplot_inla_residuals(fert.inla1, observed = fert$YIELD)
```

**Conclusions-** 

- the distribution of residuals is nearly uniform (keep in mind that
  the sample size is very small in this example).
- the fitted values approximate the observed values very well	

The following figure represents the equivalent of a (standardised)
residual plot.

```{r fitModel3e5, results='markdown', eval=TRUE, mhidden=TRUE}
ggplot_inla_residuals2(fert.inla1, observed = fert$YIELD)
```


### DHARMa residuals

Unfortunately, `DHARMa` does not directly support `INLA`.  Therefore,
in order to make use of this framework, we need to do some of the
heavy lifting.  Specifically, we need to generate the posterior
predictions associated with the observed data.

Whilst we can draw random samples from the posterior with the
`inla.posterior.sample()` _function_, this will only account for
uncertainty in the fixed parameter estimates.  That is, it will not
incorporate the overall uncertainty in the Gaussian distribution
($\sigma$).  Therefore, we need to add this back on ourself (keep in
mind that this will be in units of precision and thus needs to be
back-scaled into units of standard deviation).  Furthermore, we will
need to use the estimates of standard deviation to estimate the random
noise to add onto the predictions.  This is done by resampling the
family (Gaussian in this case).

I acknowledge that this (resampling the SD) appears to be a bit of a
hack and seems to go against the `INLA` principles.  Nevertheless, we
are only doing this this for the purposes of checking residual
diagnostics.

```{r fitModel3f, results='markdown', eval=TRUE, mhidden=TRUE, fig.width = 8}
## draw 250 samples from the posterior
draws <- inla.posterior.sample(n=250, result = fert.inla)
## extract the latent predictions for the observed data
preds = t(sapply(draws, function(x) x$latent[1:nrow(fert)]))
## extract the first (family precision) hyperprior
preds.hyper <- sapply(draws, function(x) 1/sqrt(x$hyperpar[[1]]))
## use this to generate gaussian noise 
preds.hyper <- rnorm(length(preds.hyper), mean=0, sd=preds.hyper)
## add the noise to each prediction
preds <- sweep(preds, 1, preds.hyper, FUN = "+")
## generate the DHARMa residuals
fert.resids <- createDHARMa(simulatedResponse = t(preds),
                           observedResponse = fert$YIELD,
                           fittedPredictedResponse = apply(preds, 2, median),
                           integerResponse = FALSE)
fert.resids |> plot()
```

```{r fitModel3fa, results='markdown', eval=TRUE, mhidden=TRUE, fig.width = 8, fig.height = 8}
preds <- posterior_predict.inla(fert.inla, newdata=fert)
fert.resids <- createDHARMa(simulatedResponse = t(preds),
                                   observedResponse = fert$YIELD,
                                   fittedPredictedResponse = apply(preds, 2, mean),
                                   integerResponse = FALSE)
wrap_elements(~testUniformity(fert.resids)) +
               wrap_elements(~plotResiduals(fert.resids, form = factor(rep(1, nrow(fert))))) +
               wrap_elements(~plotResiduals(fert.resids)) +
               wrap_elements(~testDispersion(fert.resids)) 

```
 
**Conclusions:**

- the simulated residuals do not suggest any issues with the residuals
- there is no evidence of a lack of fit.

# Model investigation 

Rather than simply return point estimates of each of the model
parameters, Bayesian analyses capture the full posterior of each
parameter.  These are typically stored within the `list` structure of
the output object.

As with most statistical routines, the overloaded `summary()` function
provides an overall summary of the model parameters.  Typically, the
summaries will include the means / medians along with credibility
intervals and perhaps convergence diagnostics (such as R hat).
However, more thorough investigation and analysis of the parameter
posteriors requires access to the full posteriors.

There is currently a plethora of functions for extracting the full
posteriors from models.  In part, this is a reflection of a rapidly
evolving space with numerous packages providing near equivalent
functionality (it should also be noted, that over time, many of the
functions have been deprecated due to inconsistencies in their names).
Broadly speaking, the functions focus on draws from the posterior of
either the parameters (intercept, slope, standard deviation etc),
**linear predictor**, **expected values** or **predicted values**.
The distinction between the latter three are highlighted in the
following table.

| Property          | Description                                                                                  |
|-------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| linear predictors | values predicted on the link scale                                                           |
| expected values   | predictions (on response scale) without residual error (predicting expected mean outcome(s)) |
| predicted values  | predictions (on response scale) that incorporate residual error                              |
|                   |                                                                                              |
| fitted values     | predictions on the response scale                                                            |

The following table lists the various ways of extracting the full
posteriors of the model parameters parameters, **expected** values and
**predicted** values. The crossed out items are now deprecated and
function with a namespace of `__` mean that the functionality is
provided via a range of packages.

where $n$ is the number of MCMC samples and $p$ is the number of
parameters to estimate, $N$ is the number of newdata rows and $r$ is
the number of requested parameters.  For the `tidybayes` versions in
the table above, the function expects a model to be the first
parameter (and a dataframe to be the second).  There are also `add_`
versions which expect a dataframe to be the first argument and the
model to be the second.  These alternatives facilitate pipings with
different starting objects.

It is important to remember that when working with Bayesian models, everything
is a distribution.  Whilst point estimates (such as a mean) of the parameters
can be calculated from these distributions, we start off with a large number of
estimates per parameter.


## rstanarm 
:::: {.panel-tabset}

`rstanarm` captures the MCMC samples from `stan` within the returned list.
There are numerous ways to retrieve and summarise these samples.  The first
three provide convenient numeric summaries from which you can draw conclusions,
the last four provide ways of obtaining the full posteriors. 

### summary

The `summary()` method generates simple summaries (mean, standard deviation as
well as 10, 50 and 90 percentiles).

```{r summariseModel1a, results='markdown', eval=TRUE, mhidden=TRUE, fig.width=8, fig.height=5}
fert.rstanarm3 |> summary()
```

```{r summariseModel1a1, results='markdown', eval=TRUE, mhidden=TRUE, fig.width=8, fig.height=5, echo=FALSE}
fert.sum <- summary(fert.rstanarm3)
```

**Conclusions:**

- in the Model Info, we are informed that the total MCMC posterior sample size
  is `r nrow(as.matrix(fert.rstanarm3))` and that there were 10 raw observations.
- the estimated intercept (expected yield when fertilizer concentration is 0) is
  `r round(fert.sum[1,1],2)`.  This is the mean of the posterior distribution
  for this parameter.
- the estimated slope (rate at which yield changes per 1 unit change in
  fertilizer concentration), is `r round(fert.sum[2,1],2)` (mean) or 
  `r round(fert.sum[2,4],2)` (median) with a standard deviation of `r round(fert.sum[2,2],2)`.
  The 90% credibility intervals indicate that we are 90% confident that the slope is between 
  `r round(fert.sum[2,1],2)` and `r round(fert.sum[2,5],2)` - e.g. there is a significant positive trend.
- sigma is estimated to be `r round(fert.sum[3,1],2)`
- Rhat and number of effective samples for each parameter are also provided as
  MCMC diagnostics and all look good.


### tidyMCMC

```{r summariseModel1b, results='markdown', eval=TRUE, mhidden=TRUE, fig.width=8, fig.height=5}
tidyMCMC(fert.rstanarm3$stanfit, estimate.method='median',  conf.int=TRUE,
         conf.method='HPDinterval',  rhat=TRUE, ess=TRUE)
```
```{r summariseModel1b1, results='markdown', eval=TRUE, mhidden=TRUE, fig.width=8, fig.height=5,echo=FALSE}
fert.tidy <- tidyMCMC(fert.rstanarm3$stanfit, estimate.method='median',  conf.int=TRUE,  conf.method='HPDinterval',  rhat=TRUE, ess=TRUE)
```

**Conclusions:**

- the estimated intercept (expected yield when fertilizer concentration is 0) is
  `r round(as.numeric(fert.tidy[1,2]),2)`.  This is the median of the posterior distribution
  for this parameter.
- the estimated slope (rate at which yield changes per 1 unit change in
  fertilizer concentration), is `r round(as.numeric(fert.tidy[2,2]),2)` (median) with a standard error of `r round(as.numeric(fert.tidy[2,3]),2)`.
  The 95% credibility intervals indicate that we are 95% confident that the slope is between 
  `r round(as.numeric(fert.tidy[2,4]),2)` and `r round(as.numeric(fert.tidy[2,5]),2)` - e.g. there is a significant positive trend.
- sigma is estimated to be `r round(as.numeric(fert.tidy[3,2]),2)`
- Rhat and number of effective samples for each parameter are also provided and all look good.

### summarise_draws (posterior)

```{r summariseModel1dd, results='markdown', eval=TRUE, mhidden=TRUE, fig.width=8, fig.height=5}
fert.rstanarm3$stanfit |>
    summarise_draws(median,
                    HDInterval::hdi,
                    rhat, length, ess_bulk, ess_tail)
```

We can also alter the CI level.

```{r summariseModel1d2, results='markdown', eval=TRUE, mhidden=TRUE, fig.width=8, fig.height=5}
fert.rstanarm3$stanfit |>
    summarise_draws(median,
                    ~HDInterval::hdi(.x, credMass = 0.9),
                    rhat, length, ess_bulk, ess_tail)
```

### as_draws_df (posterior)

```{r summariseModel1m, results='markdown', eval=TRUE, mhidden=TRUE, fig.width=8, fig.height=5}
fert.rstanarm3$stanfit |> as_draws_df()

fert.rstanarm3$stanfit |>
    as_draws_df() |>
    summarise_draws(median,
                    ~ HDInterval::hdi(.x),
                    rhat,
                    ess_bulk, ess_tail)
```

### tidy_draws

This is purely a graphical depiction on the posteriors.

```{r summariseModel1d, results='markdown', eval=TRUE, mhidden=TRUE, fig.width=8, fig.height=5}
fert.rstanarm3 |> tidy_draws()
```

### gather_draws

```{r summariseModel1c, results='markdown', eval=TRUE, mhidden=TRUE, fig.width=8, fig.height=5}
fert.draw <- fert.rstanarm3 |> gather_draws(`(Intercept)`, FERTILIZER, sigma)
## OR via regex
fert.draw <- fert.rstanarm3 |> gather_draws(`.Intercept.*|FERT.*|sigma`,  regex=TRUE)
fert.draw
```

We can then summarise this

```{r summariseModel1c1, results='markdown', eval=TRUE, mhidden=TRUE, fig.width=8, fig.height=5}
fert.draw |> median_hdci()
```

```{r summariseModel1c3, results='markdown', eval=TRUE, mhidden=TRUE, fig.width=8, fig.height=5,echo=FALSE}
fert.gather <- fert.rstanarm3 |> gather_draws(`(Intercept)`,FERTILIZER,sigma) |>
  median_hdci()
```

```{r summariseModel1c4, results='markdown', eval=TRUE, mhidden=TRUE, fig.width=8, fig.height=5,echo=TRUE}
fert.rstanarm3 |> 
  gather_draws(`(Intercept)`, FERTILIZER, sigma) |> 
  ggplot() + 
  stat_halfeye(aes(x=.value,  y=.variable)) +
  facet_wrap(~.variable, scales='free')
```

**Conclusions:**

- the estimated intercept (expected yield when fertilizer concentration is 0) is
  `r round(as.numeric(fert.gather[1,2]),2)`.  This is the median of the posterior distribution
  for this parameter.
- the estimated slope (rate at which yield changes per 1 unit change in
  fertilizer concentration), is `r round(as.numeric(fert.gather[2,2]),2)` (mean) or (median).
  The 95% credibility intervals indicate that we are 95% confident that the slope is between 
  `r round(as.numeric(fert.gather[2,3]),2)` and `r round(as.numeric(fert.gather[2,4]),2)` - e.g. there is a significant positive trend.
- sigma is estimated to be `r round(as.numeric(fert.gather[3,2]),2)`

### bayesplot

```{r summariseModel1j, results='markdown', eval=TRUE, mhidden=TRUE, fig.width=8, fig.height=5}
fert.rstanarm3 |> plot(plotfun='mcmc_intervals') 
```

### spread_draws

```{r summariseModel1e, results='markdown', eval=TRUE, mhidden=TRUE, fig.width=8, fig.height=5}
fert.rstanarm3 |> spread_draws(`(Intercept)`, FERTILIZER, sigma)
# OR via regex
fert.rstanarm3 |> spread_draws(`.Intercept.*|FERT.*|sigma`,  regex=TRUE)
```

### posterior_samples
Note, this is not deprecated
```{r summariseModel1f, results='markdown', eval=TRUE, mhidden=TRUE, fig.width=8, fig.height=5}

### Empirical p-value

It is possible to obtain an empirical p-value (for those that cannot live
without p-values).  This is essentially compares (for any posterior) that the
mean is zero compared to a multivariate distribution with elliptical contours.

```{r summariseModel1h, results='markdown', eval=TRUE, mhidden=TRUE, fig.width=8, fig.height=5}
mcmcpvalue <- function(samp)
{
    ## elementary version that creates an empirical p-value for the
    ## hypothesis that the columns of samp have mean zero versus a
    ## general multivariate distribution with elliptical contours.
    
    ## differences from the mean standardized by the observed
    ## variance-covariance factor
    
    ## Note, I put in the bit for single terms
    if (length(dim(samp))==0) {
        std <- backsolve(chol(var(samp)),cbind(0, t(samp)) - mean(samp),transpose = TRUE)
        sqdist <- colSums(std * std)
        sum(sqdist[-1] > sqdist[1])/length(samp)
    }
    else {
        std <- backsolve(chol(var(samp)),cbind(0, t(samp)) - colMeans(samp),transpose = TRUE)
        sqdist <- colSums(std * std)
        sum(sqdist[-1] > sqdist[1])/nrow(samp)
    }
    
}

mcmcpvalue(as.matrix(fert.rstanarm3)[, c("FERTILIZER")])
```

## brms 
:::: {.panel-tabset}

`brms` captures the MCMC samples from `stan` within the returned list.
There are numerous ways to retrieve and summarise these samples.  The first
three provide convenient numeric summaries from which you can draw conclusions,
the last four provide ways of obtaining the full posteriors.

```

```{r summariseModel2a1, results='markdown', eval=TRUE, mhidden=TRUE, fig.width=8, fig.height=5, echo=FALSE}
fert.sum <- summary(fert.brm3)
```

**Conclusions:**

- in the initial block of information, we are reminded on the formula as well as
  chain fitting characteristics.  We are also informed that the total number of
  post-warmup MCMC samples is
  is `r nrow(as.matrix(fert.brm3))`.
- the estimated intercept (expected yield when fertilizer concentration is 0) is
  `r round(fert.sum$fixed[1,1],2)`.  This is the mean of the posterior distribution
  for this parameter.
- the estimated slope (rate at which yield changes per 1 unit change in
  fertilizer concentration), is `r round(fert.sum$fixed[2,1],2)` (mean) with a 
  standard error of `r round(fert.sum$fixed[2,2],2)`.
  The 95% credibility intervals indicate that we are 95% confident that the slope is between 
  `r round(fert.sum$fixed[2,3],2)` and `r round(fert.sum$fixed[2,4],2)` - e.g. there is a significant positive trend.
- sigma is estimated to be `r round(fert.sum$spec_pars[1,1],2)`
- Rhat and number of effective samples for each parameter are also provided as

fert.tidy <- tidyMCMC(fert.brm3$fit, estimate.method='median',  conf.int=TRUE,  conf.method='HPDinterval',  rhat=TRUE, ess=TRUE)
```

**Conclusions:**

- the estimated intercept (expected yield when fertilizer concentration is 0) is
  `r round(as.numeric(fert.tidy[1,2]),2)`.  This is the median of the posterior distribution
  for this parameter.
- the estimated slope (rate at which yield changes per 1 unit change in

  The 95% credibility intervals indicate that we are 95% confident that the slope is between 
  `r round(as.numeric(fert.tidy[2,4]),2)` and `r round(as.numeric(fert.tidy[2,5]),2)` - e.g. there is a significant positive trend.

fert.brm3 |> get_variables()
fert.brm3$fit |>
    tidy_draws() |>
    dplyr::select(matches('^b_.*|^sigma'))  |>
    summarise_draws(median,
                    HDInterval::hdi,
                    rhat, length, ess_bulk, ess_tail)
```

The above can be useful for exploring the full posteriors of all the
parameters of performing specific calculations using the posteriors,
summarising the parameters takes a few more steps.

```{r summariseModel2d, results='markdown', eval=TRUE, mhidden=TRUE, fig.width=8, fig.height=5}
fert.brm3 |>
    tidy_draws() |>
    gather_variables() |>
    median_hdci()
```

The `gather_draws` on the other hand, conveniently combines
`tidy_draws` and `gather_variables` together in a single command.
Furthermore, it returns all of the variables.  The `spread_draws`
function allows users to target specific variables (either by naming
them in full or via regexp).

### gather_draws

```{r summariseModel2c, results='markdown', eval=TRUE, mhidden=TRUE, fig.width=8, fig.height=5}
fert.brm3 |> get_variables()
fert.brm3 |>
    gather_draws(b_Intercept, b_FERTILIZER, sigma) |>
    median_hdci()
## OR via regex
fert.brm3 |>
    gather_draws(`b_.*|sigma`,  regex=TRUE) |>
    median_hdci()
```
```{r summariseModel2c1, results='markdown', eval=TRUE, mhidden=TRUE, fig.width=8, fig.height=5,echo=FALSE}
fert.gather <- fert.brm3 |>
    gather_draws(b_Intercept, b_FERTILIZER, sigma) |>
    median_hdci()
```

```{r summariseModel2c2, results='markdown', eval=TRUE, mhidden=TRUE, fig.width=8, fig.height=5,echo=TRUE}
fert.brm3 |> 
  gather_draws(b_Intercept, b_FERTILIZER, sigma) |> 
  ggplot() + 
  stat_halfeye(aes(x = .value,  y = .variable)) +
  facet_wrap(~.variable, scales = 'free')

fert.brm3 |> 
  gather_draws(b_Intercept, b_FERTILIZER, sigma) |> 
  ggplot() + 
  stat_halfeye(aes(x = .value,  y = .variable)) 
```

**Conclusions:**

- the estimated intercept (expected yield when fertilizer concentration is 0) is
  `r round(as.numeric(fert.gather[1,2]),2)`.  This is the median of the posterior distribution
  for this parameter.
- the estimated slope (rate at which yield changes per 1 unit change in
  fertilizer concentration), is `r round(as.numeric(fert.gather[2,2]),2)` (mean) or (median).
  The 95% credibility intervals indicate that we are 95% confident that the slope is between 
  `r round(as.numeric(fert.gather[2,3]),2)` and `r round(as.numeric(fert.gather[2,4]),2)` - e.g. there is a significant positive trend.
- sigma is estimated to be `r round(as.numeric(fert.gather[3,2]),2)`

### Empirical p-value

It is possible to obtain an empirical p-value (for those that cannot live
without p-values).  This is essentially compares (for any posterior) that the
mean is zero compared to a multivariate distribution with elliptical contours.

```{r summariseModel2h, results='markdown', eval=TRUE, mhidden=TRUE, fig.width=8, fig.height=5}
mcmcpvalue <- function(samp)
{
    ## elementary version that creates an empirical p-value for the
    ## hypothesis that the columns of samp have mean zero versus a
    ## general multivariate distribution with elliptical contours.
    
    ## differences from the mean standardized by the observed
    ## variance-covariance factor
    
    ## Note, I put in the bit for single terms
    if (length(dim(samp))==0) {
        std <- backsolve(chol(var(samp)),cbind(0, t(samp)) - mean(samp),transpose = TRUE)
        sqdist <- colSums(std * std)
        sum(sqdist[-1] > sqdist[1])/length(samp)
    }
    else {
        std <- backsolve(chol(var(samp)),cbind(0, t(samp)) - colMeans(samp),transpose = TRUE)
        sqdist <- colSums(std * std)
        sum(sqdist[-1] > sqdist[1])/nrow(samp)
    }
    
}

mcmcpvalue(as.matrix(fert.brm3)[, c("b_FERTILIZER")])
```

## INLA 
:::: {.panel-tabset}

INLA captures a summary of the parameter posteriors within the fitted object.

### summary
The `summary()` method generates simple summaries (mean, standard deviation as
well as 10, 50 and 90 percentiles).

```{r summariseModel3a, results='markdown', eval=TRUE, mhidden=TRUE, fig.width=8, fig.height=5}
fert.inla1 |> summary()
```

```{r summariseModel3a1, results='markdown', eval=TRUE, mhidden=TRUE, fig.width=8, fig.height=5, echo=FALSE}
fert.inla1.sum <- summary(fert.inla1)
```

**Conclusions:**

- in the initial block of information, we are reminded of the function _call_
- a breakdown of the various components of the time taken for the
  analysis to run
- the 'Fixed effects' indicate that the:
  -  estimated Intercept is `r fert.inla1.sum$fixed[1,1]` (mean) or 
     `r fert.inla1.sum$fixed[1,4]` (median)
  -  estimated slope is `r fert.inla1.sum$fixed[2,1]` (mean) or 
     `r fert.inla1.sum$fixed[2,4]` (median)
  -  the 95% Credibility intervals indicate that we are 95% confident
     that the slope is between `r fert.inla1.sum$fixed[2,3]` and 
	 `r fert.inla1.sum$fixed[2,5]`
- the `Model hyperparameters' indicate that the:
  -  the precision of the Gaussian distribution is 
     `r fert.inla1.sum$hyperpar[1,1]` (mean) and 
	 `r fert.inla1.sum$hyperpar[1,4]` (median) .  Precision is $\tau = 1/\sigma^2$
     and thus, $\sigma$ is estimated to be 
	 `r 1/sqrt(fert.inla1.sum$hyperpar[1,4])`
  -  WAIC (Watanabe-Akaike information criterion is estimated to be 
     `r fert.inla1.sum$waic$waic`

### Posterior draws 
::::: {.panel-tabset}

Since INLA is a Bayesian approximation, unlike full Bayesian methods,
there are not chains of posterior draws.  However, we can use the
`inla.posterior.sample()` _function_, to **generate** draws of
parameter and fitted value posteriors from the fitted model.  In the
following code snippet, we will generate 1000 draws from the fitted
model (for repeatability, I will also set a random seed).

The output of this function is a _list_ and items are packed in
according to the sample (draw) number.  I find this awkward to work
with and prefer to have the data organised by parameters.  However,
prior to reorganising the list, I will query the latent (fixed and
fitted values) parameter names to help with filtering to just the ones
I am interested in later on.

```{r posteriors3b, results='markdown', eval=TRUE, mhidden=TRUE, fig.width=4, fig.height=3}
## Get all the draws as a list
n <- 1000
draws <- inla.posterior.sample(n = n, result = fert.inla1, seed = 1)
## Redimension the list for the latent (fixed and fitted) values 
(latent.names <- draws[[1]]$latent |> rownames())
```

The names that begin with `Predictor:` are the _fitted_ values.
Essentially, they are the estimated predicted values associated with
the observed data.  The `(Intercept):1` and `FERTILIZER:1` are the
intercept and slope respectively.

Now to convert the list of draws into a data.frame.

```{r posteriors3c, results='markdown', eval=TRUE, mhidden=TRUE, fig.width=4, fig.height=3}
draws <- sapply(draws, function(x) x[['latent']]) |>
    as.data.frame() |>
    set_names(paste0('Draw',1:n)) |>
    mutate(Parameter = latent.names) |>
    dplyr::select(Parameter, everything())
draws
```

This will convert the list into a $s\times p$ data.frame, where $s$ is
the number of draws (1000 in this case) and $p$ is the number of
latent parameters (12 in this case) plus an additional column to keep
track of the Parameters.

Finally, we might like to lengthen this data set for more convenient
plotting and summarising.

```{r posteriors3d, results='markdown', eval=TRUE, mhidden=TRUE, fig.width=4, fig.height=3}
fert.draws <- draws |> pivot_longer(cols =- Parameter, names_to='Draws')
fert.draws
```

#### Intervals

To focus on and filter to just the fixed effects, we could now:

```{r posteriors3e, results='markdown', eval=TRUE, mhidden=TRUE, fig.width=4, fig.height=3}
fert.draws |>
    filter(grepl('Intercept|FERTILIZER', Parameter)) |>
    group_by(Parameter) |>
    median_hdci(value)

fert.draws |>
    filter(grepl('Intercept|FERTILIZER', Parameter)) |>
    ggplot(aes(x=value, y= Parameter)) +
    geom_vline(xintercept = 0, linetype = 'dashed') + 
    stat_pointinterval(point_interval = median_hdci)
## or separate into panels
fert.draws |>
    filter(grepl('Intercept|FERTILIZER', Parameter)) |>
    ggplot(aes(x=value)) +
    geom_vline(xintercept = 0) +
    stat_pointinterval(point_interval = median_hdci) +
    facet_grid(~Parameter, scales = 'free_x')
```

#### Density intervals 

```{r posteriors3f, results='markdown', eval=TRUE, mhidden=TRUE, fig.width=4, fig.height=3}
fert.draws |>
    filter(grepl('Intercept|FERTILIZER', Parameter)) |>
    group_by(Parameter) |>
    nest() |>
    mutate(hpd = map(data, ~median_hdci(.x$value)),
           Density = map(data, function(.x) {d <- density(.x$value); data.frame(x=d$x, y=d$y)}),
           Quant = map2(Density, hpd, ~factor(findInterval(.x$x, .y[,c('ymin','ymax')])))
           ) |>
    unnest(c(Density, Quant)) |>
    ggplot(aes(x = x, y=y, fill = Quant)) +
    geom_vline(xintercept = 0) +
    geom_ribbon(aes(ymin=0, ymax = y)) +
    facet_wrap(~Parameter, scales = "free") 
```

# Predictions

<!-- START_PRIVATE-->
::: {.panel-tabset}

There are a large number of candidate routines for performing prediction. We
will go through many of these.  It is worth noting that prediction is
technically the act of estimating what we expect to get if we were to collect a
**single** new observation from a particular population (e.g. a specific level
of fertilizer concentration).  Often this is not what we want.  Often we want
the **fitted** values - estimates of what we expect to get if we were to collect
**multiple** new observations and average them. 

So while fitted values represent the expected underlying processes occurring in
the system, predicted values represent our expectations from sampling from such
processes.

For simple models prediction is essentially taking the model formula complete
with parameter (coefficient) estimates and solving for new values of the
predictor. To explore this, we will use the fitted model to predict Yield for a
Fertilizer concentration of 110.

We will therefore start by establishing this prediction domain as a data frame
to use across all of the prediction routines.

:::: {.panel-tabset}

As with most things to do with INLA, things are done a little
differently.  In INLA, there are three options for predictions:

1. generate draws of the parameters and calculate the outer product of
   these and a model matrix associated with the newdata.
2. bind the newdata to the observed data when fitting the model which
   will result in INLA estimating the fitted values during model
   fitting. In this approach, the response values associated with the
   newdata should all be `NA`.
3. define a linear combinations and pass this into the model during
   fitting

Lets explore each of these in turn.

### From draws

# Hypothesis testing 
<!-- START_PRIVATE-->
::: {.panel-tabset}

Since we have the entire posterior, we are able to make probability statements.
We simply count up the number of MCMC sample draws that satisfy a condition (e.g
represent a slope greater than 0) and then divide by the total number of MCMC
samples.

For this exercise, we will explore the following:

- what this the probability that Yield increases with increasing Fertilizer
  concentration - this is just asking what proportion of the drawn slopes are
  greater than 0.
- how much of a change in yield do we expect if fertilizer concentration is
  increased from 100 to 200 units and what is the probability that the change is
  more than 50%

### Prob. of effect

```{r Probability1a, results='markdown', eval=TRUE, mhidden=TRUE, fig.width=8, fig.height=5}
fert.rstanarm3 |> hypothesis('FERTILIZER>0')
```

**Conclusions:**

- the probability of a positive effect of Fertilizer on grass Yield is 1.  That
  is, there is, we are 100% confident that there is an effect.
- the evidence ratio is normally the ratio of the number of cases that satisfy
  the hypothesis to the number of cases that do not.  Since the number of cases
  that do not satisfy the hypothesis is 0, the evidence ratio is Inf (since
  division by 0)

Alternatively...

```{r Probability1b, results='markdown', eval=TRUE, mhidden=TRUE, fig.width=8, fig.height=5,paged.print=FALSE}
fert.rstanarm3 |> tidy_draws() |> summarise(P=mean(FERTILIZER>0))
```

**Conclusions:**

- the probability of a positive effect of Fertilizer on grass Yield is 1.  That
  is, there is, we are 100% confident that there is an effect.

### ROPE

The procedure highlighted above for calculating excedence
probabilities evaluates the degree of evidence for a effect in a
particular direction.  However, there are other instances where there
is a desire to evaluate the evidence that something has change (either
increased or decreased).  Such purposes are similar to the Frequentist
pursuit of testing a null hypothesis (e.g. effect = 0).

The Region of Practical Equivalence (ROPE) evaluates evidence that an
effect is "practically equivalent" to a value (e.g. 0) by calculating
the proportion of effects that are within a nominated range.
@Kruschke-2018-270 argued that for standardized parameters, the range
of -0.1 to 0.1 would envelop a negligible effect based on @Cohen-1988.
@Kruschke-2018-270 also suggested that this range could be extended to
non-standardized parameters by multiplying by the standard deviation
of the response.  Accordingly, calculating the proportion of posterior
density within this ROPE could act as a form of "null-hypothesis"
testing in a Bayesian framework.

```{r Probability1bb, results='markdown', eval=TRUE, mhidden=TRUE, fig.width=8, fig.height=5,paged.print=FALSE}
0.1 * sd(fert$YIELD)/sd(fert$FERTILIZER)
## Cannot pipe to rope if want to pipe rope to plot()
bayestestR::rope(fert.rstanarm3, parameters = 'FERTILIZER', range = c(-0.08, 0.08), ci_method = "HDI") 
bayestestR::rope(fert.rstanarm3, parameters = 'FERTILIZER', range = c(-0.08, 0.08), ci_method = "HDI") |> plot()

bayestestR::equivalence_test(fert.rstanarm3, parameters = 'FERTILIZER', range = c(-0.08, 0.08), ci_method = "HDI")  
bayestestR::equivalence_test(fert.rstanarm3, parameters = 'FERTILIZER', range = c(-0.08, 0.08), ci_method = "HDI") |> plot()

```

### Change 100 to 200 (Method 1)

```{r Probability1c, results='markdown', eval=TRUE, mhidden=TRUE, fig.width=8, fig.height=5, echo=1:2}
newdata <- list(FERTILIZER=c(200, 100)) 
fert.rstanarm3 |> emmeans(~FERTILIZER,  at=newdata) |> pairs()
fert.mcmc <- fert.rstanarm3 |> emmeans(~FERTILIZER,  at=newdata) |> pairs() |>
  as.data.frame()
```

**Conclusions:**

- the change in Yield associated with an increase in Fertilizer concentration
  from 100 to 200 is `r fert.mcmc[1, 2] |> round(2)`.

We can alternatively express this as a percentage change...

```{r Probability1c2, results='markdown', eval=TRUE, mhidden=TRUE, fig.width=8, fig.height=5, echo=1:2}
newdata <- list(FERTILIZER=c(200, 100)) 
fert.rstanarm3 |> emmeans(~FERTILIZER,  at=newdata) |> regrid(transform = "log") |> pairs() |> regrid()
```

If we want to derive other properties, such as the percentage change, then we
use `tidy_draws()` and then simple `tidyverse` spreadsheet operation.

```{r Probability1d, results='markdown', eval=TRUE, mhidden=TRUE, fig.width=8, fig.height=5}
fert.rstanarm3 |> emmeans(~FERTILIZER,  at=newdata) |>
    regrid(transform = "log") |>
    pairs() |>
    regrid() |>
    tidy_draws() |>
    summarise_draws(median,
                    HDInterval::hdi,
                    P= ~ mean(.x>1.5))

fert.mcmc <- fert.rstanarm3 |> emmeans(~FERTILIZER,  at=newdata) |> 
  tidy_draws() |>
  rename_with(~str_replace(., 'FERTILIZER ', 'p')) |>
  mutate(Eff=p200 - p100,
         PEff=100*Eff/p100)
fert.mcmc |> head()
```

Now we can calculate the medians and HPD intervals of each column (and ignore
the `.chain`, `.iteration` and `.draw`).

```{r Probability1e, results='markdown', eval=TRUE, mhidden=TRUE, fig.width=8, fig.height=5}
fert.mcmc |> tidyMCMC(estimate.method='median',
                       conf.int=TRUE, conf.method='HPDinterval')
```

Alternatively, we could use `median_hdci`

```{r Probability1f, results='markdown', eval=TRUE, mhidden=TRUE, fig.width=8, fig.height=5}
fert.mcmc |> median_hdci(PEff)
fert.mcmc |> median_hdci(PEff, Eff)
```

**Conclusions:**

- the percentage change in Yield associated with an increase in Fertilizer concentration
  from 100 to 200 is `r fert.mcmc |> median_hdci(PEff) |> _[1, 1] |> as.numeric() |> round(2)`% 
  with a 95% credibility interval of 
  `r fert.mcmc |> median_hdci(PEff) |> _[1, 2] |> as.numeric() |> round(2)`
  `r fert.mcmc |> median_hdci(PEff) |> _[1, 3] |> as.numeric() |> round(2)`

To get the probability that the effect is greater than a 50% increase.
```{r Probability1g, results='markdown', eval=TRUE, mhidden=TRUE, fig.width=8, fig.height=5, paged.print=FALSE}
fert.mcmc |> summarise(P=mean(PEff>50))
```

**Conclusions:**

- the probability that Yield will increase by more than 50 following an increase
  in Fertilizer concentration from 100 to 200 is
  `r fert.mcmc |> summarise(P=mean(PEff>50)) |> as.numeric() |> round(2)`.


Finally, we could alternatively use `hypothesis()`. Note that when we do so, the
estimate is the difference between the effect and the hypothesised effect (50%).

```{r Probability1h, results='markdown', eval=TRUE, mhidden=TRUE, fig.width=8, fig.height=5}
fert.mcmc |> hypothesis('PEff>50')
```

- the change in Yield associated with an increase in Fertilizer concentration
  from 100 to 200 is `r fert.mcmc[1, 2] |> round(2)`.

We can alternatively express this as a percentage change...

    pairs(reverse =  TRUE) |>

```

If we want to derive other properties, such as the percentage change, then we
use `tidy_draws()` and then simple `tidyverse` spreadsheet operation.

It is in combination with `emmeans()` that `tidy_draws()` really comes into its own.

```{r Probability2d, results='markdown', eval=TRUE, mhidden=TRUE, fig.width=8, fig.height=5}
fert.brm3 |> emmeans(~FERTILIZER,  at=newdata) |>

    summarise_draws(median,
                    HDInterval::hdi,
                    P= ~ mean(.x>1.5))

fert.mcmc <- fert.brm3 |>
    emmeans(~FERTILIZER,  at = newdata) |> 
    tidy_draws() |>
    rename_with(~str_replace(., 'FERTILIZER ', 'p')) |>
    mutate(Eff=p200 - p100,
           PEff=100*Eff/p100)
fert.mcmc |> head()
```

Now we can calculate the medians and HPD intervals of each column (and ignore
the `.chain`, `.iteration` and `.draw`).

```{r Probability2e, results='markdown', eval=TRUE, mhidden=TRUE, fig.width=8, fig.height=5}
fert.mcmc |>
    tidyMCMC(estimate.method='median',
             conf.int=TRUE, conf.method='HPDinterval')
```

Alternatively, we could use `median_hdci()` to focus on a specific column.

```{r Probability2f, results='markdown', eval=TRUE, mhidden=TRUE, fig.width=8, fig.height=5}
fert.mcmc |> median_hdci(PEff)
fert.mcmc |> median_hdci(PEff, Eff)
```

```{r Probability2ff, results='markdown', eval=TRUE, mhidden=TRUE, fig.width=8, fig.height=5}
fert.mcmc |>
    ggplot() +
    geom_density(aes(x=PEff))
```

**Conclusions:**

- the percentage change in Yield associated with an increase in Fertilizer concentration
  from 100 to 200 is `r fert.mcmc |> median_hdci(PEff) |> _[1, 1] |> as.numeric() |> round(2)`% 
  with a 95% credibility interval of 
  `r fert.mcmc |> median_hdci(PEff) |> _[1, 2] |> as.numeric() |> round(2)`
  `r fert.mcmc |> median_hdci(PEff) |> _[1, 3] |> as.numeric() |> round(2)`

To get the probability that the effect is greater than a 50% increase.
```{r Probability2g, results='markdown', eval=TRUE, mhidden=TRUE, fig.width=8, fig.height=5, paged.print=FALSE}
fert.mcmc |> summarise(P=mean(PEff>50))
```

**Conclusions:**

- the probability that Yield will increase by more than 50 following an increase
  in Fertilizer concentration from 100 to 200 is
  `r fert.mcmc |> summarise(P=mean(PEff>50)) |> as.numeric() |> round(2)`.


Finally, we could alternatively use `hypothesis()`. Note that when we do so, the
estimate is the difference between the effect and the hypothesised effect (50%).

```{r Probability2h, results='markdown', eval=TRUE, mhidden=TRUE, fig.width=8, fig.height=5}

```{r Probability2i, results='markdown', eval=TRUE, mhidden=TRUE, fig.width=8, fig.height=5}
newdata = list(FERTILIZER=c(200, 100)) 
fert.brm3 |>
    emmeans(~FERTILIZER,  at=newdata) |>
    pairs() |>
    tidy_draws() |>
    summarise(across(contains('contrast'),
                     list(P = ~ mean(.>80),
                          HDCI = ~ median_hdci(.)),
                     .names = c('{.fn}')
                     )) |>
    tidyr::unpack(HDCI)
```

We can also express this as a percentage change

```{r Probability2j, results='markdown', eval=TRUE, mhidden=TRUE, fig.width=8, fig.height=5}
newdata = list(FERTILIZER=c(200, 100)) 
## Simple
fert.brm3 |>
    emmeans(~FERTILIZER,  at=newdata) |>
    regrid(transform = 'log') |>
    pairs() |>
    regrid() 

## More advanced (both P and percent change)
fert.mcmc <- fert.brm3 |>
    emmeans(~FERTILIZER,  at=newdata) |>
    regrid(transform = 'log') |>
    pairs() |>
    regrid() |>
    tidy_draws() |>
    mutate(across(contains('contrast'), ~ 100*(. - 1)))

fert.mcmc |>
    summarise(across(contains('contrast'),
                     list(P = ~ mean(.>50),
                          HDCI = ~ median_hdci(.)),
                     .names = c('{.fn}')
                     )) |>
    tidyr::unpack(HDCI)

```

### Change 100 to 200 (Method 3)

```{r Probability2k, results='markdown', eval=TRUE, mhidden=TRUE, fig.width=8, fig.height=5}
fert.brm3 |>
    linpred_draws(newdata = as.data.frame(newdata)) |>
    ungroup() |>
    group_by(.draw) |>
    summarise(Eff = -1 * diff(.linpred),
              PEff = 100*Eff/.linpred[2]) |>
    ungroup() |>
    mutate(P = mean(PEff>50)) |>
    pivot_longer(cols = -.draw) |>
    group_by(name) |>
    median_hdci()

##OR
fert.brm3 |>
    epred_draws(newdata = as.data.frame(newdata)) |>
    ungroup() |>
    group_by(.draw) |>
    summarise(Eff = -1 * diff(.epred),

    mutate(P = mean(PEff>50)) |>
    pivot_longer(cols = -.draw) |>
    group_by(name) |>
    median_hdci()

##OR for prediction of individual values

    predicted_draws(newdata = as.data.frame(newdata)) |>
    ungroup() |>
    group_by(.draw) |>
    summarise(Eff = -1 * diff(.prediction),
              PEff = 100*Eff/.prediction[2]) |>
    ungroup() |>
    mutate(P = mean(PEff>50)) |>

# Methods 

- The relationship between grass yield and fertiliser concentration
  was explored using linear regression in a Bayesian framework.
- specifically, the yield of grass was modelled against fertiliser 
  concentration with a Gaussian family and weakly informative priors.
- (equation and priors)
- the Bayesian model included 3 chains, each of 5000 iterations, 
  thinned to a rate of 5, and excluded the first 1000 iterations (warmup)
- the model was found to be well mixed and converged (all Rhat <
  1.05) on a stable posterior (see suppl.) and was validated via 
  DHARMa (cite) residuals
- all statistical models were performed in the R (4.4.1) Statistical
  and Graphical Environment [@R-4.4.1] via the _brms_ [@brms] package

# Results

- Grass yield was found to have a positive linear relationship with
  fertiliser concentration (stats)
- Every one unit increase in fertiliser concentration was found to be
  associated with a 0.8 gram increase in grass yield
- Doubling the fertiliser concentration from 100 to 200 (units) is
  expected to increase the yield by x grams
