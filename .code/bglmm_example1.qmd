# Scenario

A plant pathologist wanted to examine the effects of two different
strengths of tobacco virus on the number of lesions on tobacco leaves.
She knew from pilot studies that leaves were inherently very variable
in response to the virus. In an attempt to account for this leaf to
leaf variability, both treatments were applied to each leaf. Eight
individual leaves were divided in half, with half of each leaf
inoculated with weak strength virus and the other half inoculated with
strong virus. So the leaves were blocks and each treatment was
represented once in each block. A completely randomised design would
have had 16 leaves, with 8 whole leaves randomly allocated to each
treatment.

# Exploratory data analysis
<!-- START_PRIVATE-->
::: {.panel-tabset}
Along with ensuring that all categorical variables are specifically declared as
factors, if we intend to use either `rstanarm` or `brms`, we also need to ensure
that all __varying__ effects are also declared as factors. 

```{r processData, results='markdown', eval=TRUE}
tobacco <- tobacco |> mutate(LEAF = factor(LEAF),
                             TREATMENT = factor(TREATMENT))
tobacco |> head()
```

## Boxplots

To explore the assumptions of homogeneity of variance and normality, a boxplot
of each Treatment level is appropriate.

```{r tobaccoEDA2, results='markdown', eval=TRUE, mhidden=TRUE}
ggplot(tobacco,  aes(y = NUMBER,  x = TREATMENT)) +
  geom_boxplot()
```

**Conclusions:**

- both normality and homogeneity of variance seem satisfied

## Line plots
It can also be useful to get a sense of the consistency across blocks (LEAF).
That is, do all Leaves have a similar baseline level of lesion susceptibility
and do they respond similarly to the treatment.

```{r tobaccoEDA3, results='markdown', eval=TRUE, mhidden=TRUE}
ggplot(tobacco,  aes(y = NUMBER,  x = as.numeric(LEAF))) +
  geom_line(aes(linetype = TREATMENT))

## If we want to retain the original LEAF labels
ggplot(tobacco,  aes(y = NUMBER,  x = as.numeric(LEAF))) +
  geom_blank(aes(x = LEAF)) +
  geom_line(aes(linetype = TREATMENT))
```

**Conclusions:**

- it is clear that some leaves are more susceptible to lesions (e.g. Leaf 7)
  than other leaves (e.g. Leaf 4)
- most leaves (other than Leaf 4 and 6) have a similar response to the
  Treatments - that is most have higher number of lesions from the Strong
  Treatment than the Weak Treatment.

## Paired plots
Given that there are only two levels of Treatment (Strong and Weak), it might be
easier to visualise the differences in baselines and effect consistency by
plotting as:

```{r tobaccoEDA4, results='markdown', eval=TRUE, mhidden=TRUE}
ggplot(tobacco,  aes(y = NUMBER,  x = TREATMENT,  group = LEAF)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_line(aes(x = as.numeric(TREATMENT))) 
```

**Conclusions:**

- this figure reiterates the points made earlier about the varying baselines and
  effect consistency.


The above figure also serves as a good way to visualise certain aspects of mixed
effects models.  When we fit a mixed effects model that includes a random
blocking effect (in this case LEAF), we are indicating that we are allowing
there to be a different intercept for each block (LEAF).  In the current case,
the intercept will represent the first Treatment level (Strong).  So the random
effect is specifying that the intercept can vary from Leaf to Leaf.

We can think of the model as having two tiers (a hierarchy), where the tiers of
the hierarchy represent progressively smaller (typically) spatial scales.  In
the current example, the largest spatial units are the leaves (blocking factor).
Within the leaves, there are the two Treatments (Strong and Weak) and within the
Treatments are the individual observations.

From a frequentist perspective, this model might be referred to as a mixed
effects model in which the `TREATMENT` is a 'fixed' effect and the `LEAF` is a
'random' effect.  Such terminology is inconsistent in a Bayesian context since
all parameters are 'random'.  Instead, these would be referred to as
_population-level_ and _group-level_ effects respectively.  Group-level effects
are so called because they are effects that differ within each group (e.g. level
of a blocking factor), whereas population effects are those that have been
pooled across all groups.

where:

- $\bf{X}$ is the model matrix representing the overall intercept and
  effects of the treatment on the number of lesions.
- $\boldsymbol{\beta}$ is a vector of the population-level effects
  parameters to be estimated.
- $\boldsymbol{\gamma}$ is a vector of the group-level effect parameters
- $\bf{Z}$ represents a cell means model matrix for the random intercepts (and
  possibly random slopes) associated with leaves.
- the population-level intercept ($\beta_0$) has a gaussian prior with location
  of 31 and scale of 10
- the population-level effect ($\beta_1$) has a gaussian prior with location of
  0 and scale of 10
- the group-level effects are assumed to sum-to-zero and be drawn from a
  gaussian distribution with mean of 0 and covariance of $\Sigma$  
- $\boldsymbol{\Sigma}$ is the variance-covariance matrix between the
  groups (individual leaves).  It turns out that it is difficult to
  apply a prior on this covariance matrix, so instead, the covariance
  matrix is decomposed into a correlation matrix
  ($\boldsymbol{\Omega}$) and a vector of variances
  ($\boldsymbol{\sigma_l}$) which are the diagonals ($\boldsymbol{D}$)
  of the covariance matrix.

where $\Sigma$ is a covariance matrix.

<!-- START_PRIVATE-->

It turns out that it is difficult to apply a prior on a covariance matrix, so
instead, we decompose the covariance matrix into a correlation matrix and variance.

https://jrnold.github.io/bayesian_notes/appendix.html - Section 20.15.3 Covariance-Correlation Matrix Decomposition

- Covariance matrix can be decomposed into a correlation matrix and a vector of
  variances
- The variances can be further decomposed into the product of a
  simplex vector (which is a probability vector, non-negative and sums
  to 1) and the trace (product of the order of the matrix and the
  scale of the scale parameter, also the sum of its diagonal elements)
  of a matrix.  Each element of the simplex vector represents the
  proportion of the trace that is attributable to the corresponding
  variable.
- A prior on all the above is a decov (decomposition of covariance) function

- The prior on the correlation matrix is called LKJ
- density is proportional to the determinant of the correlation matrix raised to
  the power of the positive regularization paramter minus one.

- The prior on the simplex vector is a symmetric Dirichlet prior which
  has a single (positive) concentration parameter (default of 1
  implying the prior is jointly uniform over the same of simplex
  vectors of that size) A symmetric Dirichlet prior is used for the
  simplex vector.  The Dirichlet prior has a single (positive)
  concentration parameter

- The positive scale paramter has a gamma prior (with default shape
  and scale of 1 - implying a unit-exponential distribution)

- alternatively, the lkj prior can be used for covariance.
- as with decov, it decomposes into correlation and variances, however the
  variances are not further decomosed into a simplex vector and trace.
- instead the standard deviations (variance squared) for each of the group
  specific paramters are given half student-t distribution with scale and df
  paramters specified through the scale (default 10) and df (default 1)
  arguments of the lkj function.
- the lkj prior is similar, yet faster than decov

### Using default priors
In `rstanarm`, the default priors are designed to be weakly informative. They
are chosen to provide moderate regularlization (to help prevent overfitting) and
help stabalise the computations.

```{r fitModel1a, results='markdown', eval=TRUE, mhidden=TRUE, cache=TRUE}
tobacco.rstanarm <- stan_glmer(NUMBER ~ (1|LEAF) + TREATMENT,
                               data = tobacco,
                               family = gaussian(), 
                               iter = 5000,
                               warmup = 2000,
                               chains = 3,
                               thin = 5,
                               refresh = 0)
```

```{r fitModel1b, results='markdown', eval=TRUE, mhidden=TRUE, cache=FALSE}
tobacco.rstanarm |> prior_summary()
```
This tells us:

- for the intercept (when the family is Gaussian), a normal prior with
  a mean of 31 and a standard deviation of 16 is used.  The 2.5 is
  used for scaling all parameter standard deviations.  The value of 31
  is based on the mean of the response (`mean(tobacco$NUMBER)`) and
  the scaled standard deviation of 16 is based on multiplying the
  scaling factor by the standard deviation of the response.

```{r fitModel1c, results='markdown', eval=TRUE, mhidden=TRUE, cache=FALSE}
2.5*sd(tobacco$NUMBER)
```

- for the coefficients (in this case, just the difference between strong and
weak innoculation), the default prior is a normal prior centered around 0 with a
standard deviation of 2.5.  This is then adjusted for the scale of the data by
multiplying the 2.5 by the ratio of the standard deviation of the response by
the stanard devation of the numerical dummy variables for the predictor (then rounded). 

```{r fitModel1d, results='markdown', eval=TRUE, mhidden=TRUE, cache=FALSE}
2.5*sd(tobacco$NUMBER)/apply(model.matrix(~TREATMENT, tobacco), 2, sd)
```

-  the auxillary prior represents whatever additional prior is required for the
   nominated model.  In the case of a Gaussian model, this will be $\sigma$, for
   negative binomial, it will be the reciprocal of dispersion, for gamma, it
   will be shape, etc .  By default in `rstanarm`, this
   is a exponential with a rate of 1 which is then adjusted by devision with the
   standard deviation of the response.
   
```{r fitModel1e, results='markdown', eval=TRUE, mhidden=TRUE, cache=TRUE}
1/sd(tobacco$NUMBER)
```

 
### Assessing priors
Lets now run with priors only so that we can explore the range of values they
allow in the posteriors.

```{r fitModel1f, results='markdown', eval=TRUE, mhidden=TRUE, cache=TRUE}
tobacco.rstanarm1 <- update(tobacco.rstanarm,  prior_PD=TRUE)
```

```{r fitModel1g, results='markdown', eval=TRUE, mhidden=TRUE, cache=FALSE}
ggpredict(tobacco.rstanarm1) |> plot(add.data=TRUE)
```

**Conclusions:**

- we see that the range of predictions is faily wide and the predicted means could range
  from a small negative number to a relatively large positive number.

### Defining priors

The following link provides some guidance about defining priors.
[https://github.com/stan-dev/stan/wiki/Prior-Choice-Recommendations]

When defining our own priors, we typically do not want them to be scaled.

If we wanted to define our own priors that were less vague, yet still not likely
to bias the outcomes, we could try the following priors (mainly plucket out of
thin air):

- $\beta_0$: normal centered at 35 with a standard deviation of 7
  - mean of 33: since `median(tobacco$NUMBER)`
  - sd of 7: since `mad(tobacco$NUMBER)`
- $\beta_1$: normal centred at 0 with a standard deviation of 13
  - sd of 13: since `sd(tobacco$NUMBER) / apply(model.matrix(~TREATMENT, tobacco), 2, sd)`
- $\sigma$: exponential with rate of 0.15
  - since `1 / sd(tobacco$NUMBER)`
- $\Sigma$: decov with:
  - regularization: the exponent for a LKJ prior on the correlation matrix.  A
    value of 1 (default) implies a joint uniform prior
  - concentration: the concentration parameter for a symmetric Dirichlet
    distribution.  A value of 1 (default) implies a joint uniform distribution
  - shape and scale: the shape and scale parameters for a gamma prior on the
    scale and scale parameters of the
    decov prior.  A value of 1 for both (default) simplifies the gamma prior to
    a unit-exponential distribution.

I will also overlay the raw data for comparison.

```{r fitModel1h, results='markdown', eval=TRUE, mhidden=TRUE, cache=TRUE}
tobacco.rstanarm2 <- stan_glmer(NUMBER ~ (1|LEAF) + TREATMENT,
                                data = tobacco,
                                family = gaussian(), 
                                prior_intercept = normal(35, 7, autoscale = FALSE),
                                prior = normal(0, 13, autoscale = FALSE),
                                prior_aux=rstanarm::exponential(0.15, autoscale = FALSE),
                                prior_covariance = decov(1, 1, 1, 1), 
                                prior_PD = TRUE, 
                                iter = 5000,
                                warmup = 1000,
                                chains = 3,
                                thin = 5,
                                refresh = 0
                                )
```

```{r fitModel1i, results='markdown', eval=TRUE, mhidden=TRUE, cache=FALSE}
tobacco.rstanarm2 |>
    ggpredict() |>
    plot(add.data = TRUE)
```

Now lets refit, conditioning on the data.

```{r fitModel1j, results='markdown', eval=TRUE, mhidden=TRUE, cache=TRUE, dependson='fitModel1h'}
tobacco.rstanarm3 <- update(tobacco.rstanarm2,  prior_PD=FALSE)
```
 
### Plotting prior and posterior

```{r modelFit1k, results='markdown', eval=TRUE, mhidden=TRUE, fig.width=8, fig.height=8}
posterior_vs_prior(tobacco.rstanarm3, color_by='vs', group_by=TRUE,
                   facet_args=list(scales='free_y'))
```

**Conclusions:**

- in each case, the prior is substantially wider than the posterior, suggesting
  that the posterior is not biased towards the prior.
  
```{r modelFit1l, results='markdown', eval=TRUE, mhidden=TRUE, fig.width=6, fig.height=4}
ggemmeans(tobacco.rstanarm3,  ~TREATMENT) |> plot(add.data=TRUE)
ggpredict(tobacco.rstanarm3,  ~TREATMENT) |> plot(add.data=TRUE)
```
::::
## brms 
:::: {.panel-tabset}
### Using default priors

In `brms`, the default priors are designed to be weakly informative.  They are
chosen to provide moderate regularlization (to help prevent overfitting) and
help stabalise the computations.

Unlike `rstanarm`, `brms` models must be compiled before they start sampling.
For most models, the compilation of the stan code takes around 45 seconds.

```{r fitModel2a, results='markdown', eval=TRUE, mhidden=TRUE, cache=TRUE, paged.print=FALSE, tidy.opts = list(width.cutoff = 80), echo=c(-4,-6)}
tobacco.form <- bf(NUMBER ~ (1|LEAF) + TREATMENT,
                   family = gaussian() 
                   )
options(width=100)
tobacco.form |> get_prior(data=tobacco)
options(width=80)
## tobacco.brm <- brm(tobacco.form,
##                   data=tobacco,
##                   iter = 5000,
##                   warmup = 1000,
##                   chains = 3,
##                   thin = 5,
##                   refresh = 0)
```

- $\beta_0$: normal centered at 31 with a standard deviation of 7
  - mean of 31: since `mean(tobacco$NUMBER)`
  - sd of 7: since `sd(tobacco$NUMBER)`
- $\beta_1$: normal centred at 0 with a standard deviation of 13
  - sd of 13: since `sd(tobacco$NUMBER) / apply(model.matrix(~TREATMENT, tobacco), 2, sd)`
- $\sigma$: half-cauchy with parameters 0 and 6.5
  - since `sd(tobacco$NUMBER)`
- $\sigma_j$: half-cauchy with parameters 0 and 2.5
  - since `sqrt(sd(tobacco$NUMBER))`
  - we want this prior to have most mass close to zero for the purpose
    of **regularisation**
- $\Sigma$: decov with:
  - regularization: the exponent for a LKJ prior on the correlation matrix.  A
    value of 1 (default) implies a joint uniform prior
  - concentration: the concentration parameter for a symmetric Dirichlet
    distribution.  A value of 1 (default) implies a joint uniform distribution
  - shape and scale: the shape and scale parameters for a gamma prior on the
    scale and scale parameters of the
    decov prior.  A value of 1 for both (default) simplifies the gamma prior to
    a unit-exponential distribution.

Note, for hierarchical models, the model will tend to want to have a
large $sigma$ in order to fit the data better.  It is a good idea to
__regularise__ this tendency by applying a prior that has most mass
around zero.  Suitable candidates include:

- half-t: as the degrees of freedom approach infinity, this will approach a half-normal 
- half-cauchy: this is essentially a half-t with 1 degree of freedom
- exponential

I will also overlay the raw data for comparison.

                  thin = 5,
                  refresh = 0,
                  backend = "cmdstanr"
                  )
```

Note in the above model, the output may have included a warning
message alerting us the presence of **divergent transitions**.
Divergent transitions are an indication that the sampler has
encountered poor sampling conditions - the more divergent transitions,
the more severe the issue.

Typically, divergent transitions are the result of either:

- a miss-specified model
- priors that permit the sampler to drift into unsupported areas
- complex posterior "features" (with high degrees of curvature) for
  which the sampler was inadequately tuned during the warmup phase

One useful way to diagnose the cause of divergent transitions is to
explore a parallel coordinates plot. Each parameter is on the x-axis
and each line represents a single MCMC draw. Divergent transitions
will be highlighted in red (by default). If lines pinch together at a
particular parameter, then it points to that dimension as the cause of
divergent transitions.

```{r fitModel2h1a, results='markdown', eval=TRUE, mhidden=TRUE, cache=TRUE, fig.width = 8, fig.height = 3}
tobacco.np <- nuts_params(tobacco.brm2)
tobacco.mcmc <- as.array(tobacco.brm2)
mcmc_parcoord(x = tobacco.mcmc, np = tobacco.np) +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1))
tobacco.brm2 |> mcmc_parcoord(np = tobacco.np) +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1))
tobacco.brm2 |> mcmc_parcoord(regex_pars = "^b.*|^r.*") +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1))
```


Accordingly, these divergent transitions can be addressed by either:

- reviewing the model structure
- adopting tighter priors
- increase the **adaptive delta** from the default of 0.8 to closer
  to 1.  The adaptive delta defines the average acceptance probability
  that the sampler should aspire to during the warmup phase.
  Increasing the adaptive delta results in a smaller step size (and
  thus fewer divergences and more robust samples) however it will also
  result in slower sampling speeds.

```{r partialPlot2h1a, results='markdown', eval=TRUE, mhidden=TRUE, fig.width=8, fig.height=5}

```

                       control = list(adapt_delta = 0.99, max_treedepth =  20),
                       refresh = 0, cores = 3)

```

### Random intercept/slope model

While we are here, we might like to explore a random intercept/slope model


```{r fitModel2h3, results='markdown', eval=TRUE, mhidden=TRUE, cache=TRUE}
priors <- prior(normal(35,10), class = 'Intercept') +
    prior(normal(0, 8), class = 'b') +
    prior(student_t(3,0,5), class = 'sigma') +
    prior(cauchy(0, 5), class = 'sd') +
    prior(lkj_corr_cholesky(1), class = 'cor')
tobacco.form <- bf(NUMBER ~ (TREATMENT|LEAF) + TREATMENT,
                     family = gaussian()
                   )
 
tobacco.brm4 <-  brm(tobacco.form, 
                  data = tobacco,
                  prior = priors,
                  sample_prior = 'yes',
                  iter = 5000,
                  warmup = 1000,
                  chains = 3,
                  thin = 5,
                  refresh = 0,
                  control = list(adapt_delta=0.99),
                  backend = "cmdstanr"
                  )
save(tobacco.brm4, file = '../ws/testing/tobacco.brm4')
```

```{r posterior2k, results='markdown', eval=TRUE}
tobacco.brm4 |> get_variables()
tobacco.brm4 |> hypothesis('TREATMENTWeak=0') |> plot()
```

```{r posterior2k1, results='markdown', eval=TRUE, fig.width = 7, fig.height = 5}
tobacco.brm4 |> SUYR_prior_and_posterior()
```

```{r posterior2k2, results='markdown', eval=TRUE, fig.width=10, fig.height=4}
tobacco.brm4 |>
  posterior_samples() |>
  dplyr::select(-`lp__`) |>
  pivot_longer(everything(), names_to = 'key') |> 
  filter(!str_detect(key, '^r')) |>
  mutate(Type = ifelse(str_detect(key, 'prior'), 'Prior', 'Posterior'),
         ## Class = ifelse(str_detect(key, 'Intercept'),  'Intercept',
         ##         ifelse(str_detect(key, 'b'),  'b', 'sigma')),
         Class = case_when(
             str_detect(key, '(^b|^prior).*Intercept$') ~ 'Intercept',
             str_detect(key, 'b_TREATMENT|prior_b') ~ 'TREATMENT',
             str_detect(key, 'sd') ~ 'sd',
             str_detect(key, '^cor|prior_cor') ~ 'cor',
             str_detect(key, 'sigma') ~ 'sigma'),
         Par = str_replace(key, 'b_', '')) |>
  ggplot(aes(x = Type,  y = value, color = Par)) +
  stat_pointinterval(position = position_dodge())+
  facet_wrap(~Class,  scales = 'free')

```

### Compare models

We can compare the two models using LOO

```{r fitModel2h3a, results='markdown', eval=TRUE, mhidden=TRUE, cache=TRUE}
(l.1 <- tobacco.brm3 |> loo()) 
(l.2 <- tobacco.brm4 |> loo())
loo_compare(l.1, l.2)
```

Whilst the random intercept/slope has a slightly smaller looic, when
we consider the standard error (or rather an interval of +- 2.5xSE),
there is no support for this more complex model over the simpler
random intercept only model.  Consequently, we will continue with the
random intercept model.

# MCMC sampling diagnostics 

<!-- START_PRIVATE-->
::: {.panel-tabset}
In addition to the regular model diagnostics checking, for Bayesian analyses, it
is also necessary to explore the MCMC sampling diagnostics to be sure that the
chains are well mixed and have converged on a stable posterior.

There are a wide variety of tests that range from the big picture, overal chain
characteristics to the very specific detailed tests that allow the experienced
modeller to drill down to the very fine details of the chain behaviour.
Furthermore, there are a multitude of packages and approaches for exploring
these diagnostics.

## brms 
:::: {.panel-tabset}
### bayesplot

The `bayesplot` package offers a range of MCMC diagnostics as well as Posterior
Probability Checks (PPC), all of which have a convenient `plot()` interface.
Lets start with the MCMC diagnostics.

<details><summary>See list of available diagnostics by name</summary>
```{r modelValidation2a, results='markdown', eval=TRUE, mhidden=TRUE, fig.width=6, fig.height=4}
available_mcmc()
```
</details>

Of these, we will focus on:

- trace: this plots the estimates of each parameter over the post-warmup
  length of each MCMC chain.  Each chain is plotted in a different shade of
  blue, with each parameter in its own facet.  Ideally, each **trace** should
  just look like noise without any discernible drift and each of the traces for
  a specific parameter should look the same (i.e, should not be displaced above
  or below any other trace for that parameter).

```{r modelValidation2b, results='markdown', eval=TRUE, mhidden=TRUE, fig.width=6, fig.height=4}
tobacco.brm3 |> mcmc_plot(type='trace')
```
  
   The chains appear well mixed and very similar
   
- acf_bar (autocorrelation function): plots the autocorrelation between successive
  MCMC sample lags for each parameter and each chain
  
```{r modelValidation2c, results='markdown', eval=TRUE, mhidden=TRUE, fig.width=6, fig.height=4}
tobacco.brm3 |> mcmc_plot(type='acf_bar')
```

   There is no evidence of autocorrelation in the MCMC samples

- rhat_hist: Rhat is a **scale reduction factor** measure of convergence between the chains.  The closer the
  values are to 1, the more the chains have converged.  Values greater than 1.05
  indicate a lack of convergence.  There will be an Rhat value for each
  parameter estimated.

```{r modelValidation2d, results='markdown', eval=TRUE, mhidden=TRUE, fig.width=6, fig.height=4}
tobacco.brm3 |> mcmc_plot(type='rhat_hist')
```

  All Rhat values are below 1.05, suggesting the chains have converged.
  
- neff_hist (number of effective samples): the ratio of the number of effective
  samples (those not rejected by the sampler) to the number of samples provides
  an indication of the effectiveness (and efficiency) of the MCMC sampler.
  Ratios that are less than 0.5 for a parameter suggest that the sampler spent
  considerable time in difficult areas of the sampling domain and rejected more
  than half of the samples (replacing them with the previous effective sample).  
  
  If the ratios are low, tightening the priors may help.
  
```{r modelValidation2e, results='markdown', eval=TRUE, mhidden=TRUE, fig.width=6, fig.height=4}
tobacco.brm2 |> mcmc_plot(type='neff_hist')
```

  Ratios all very high.

<details><summary>More diagnostics</summary>
```{r modelValidation2f, results='markdown', eval=TRUE, mhidden=TRUE, fig.width=6, fig.height=4}
tobacco.brm3 |> mcmc_plot(type='combo')
tobacco.brm3 |> mcmc_plot(type='violin')
```
</details>

### stan plots

The `rstan` package offers a range of MCMC diagnostics.
Lets start with the MCMC diagnostics.

Of these, we will focus on:

- stan_trace: this plots the estimates of each parameter over the post-warmup
  length of each MCMC chain. Each chain is plotted in a different colour, with
  each parameter in its own facet. Ideally, each **trace** should just look like
  noise without any discernible drift and each of the traces for a specific
  parameter should look the same (i.e, should not be displaced above or below
  any other trace for that parameter).
  
```{r modelValidation2g, results='markdown', eval=TRUE, mhidden=TRUE, fig.width=6, fig.height=4}
tobacco.brm3 |> get_variables()
pars <- tobacco.brm3 |> get_variables()
pars <- str_extract(pars, '^b_.*|^sigma$|^sd.*') |> na.omit()

tobacco.brm3$fit |> stan_trace(pars = pars)
```

   The chains appear well mixed and very similar
   
- stan_acf (autocorrelation function): plots the autocorrelation between successive
  MCMC sample lags for each parameter and each chain
  
```{r modelValidation2h, results='markdown', eval=TRUE, mhidden=TRUE, fig.width=6, fig.height=4}
tobacco.brm3$fit |>
    stan_ac(pars = pars)
```

   There is no evidence of autocorrelation in the MCMC samples

- stan_rhat: Rhat is a **scale reduction factor** measure of convergence between the chains.  The closer the
  values are to 1, the more the chains have converged.  Values greater than 1.05
  indicate a lack of convergence.  There will be an Rhat value for each
  parameter estimated.

```{r modelValidation2i, results='markdown', eval=TRUE, mhidden=TRUE, fig.width=6, fig.height=4}
tobacco.brm3$fit |> stan_rhat() 
```

  All Rhat values are below 1.05, suggesting the chains have converged.
  
- stan_ess (number of effective samples): the ratio of the number of effective
  samples (those not rejected by the sampler) to the number of samples provides
  an indication of the effectiveness (and efficiency) of the MCMC sampler.
  Ratios that are less than 0.5 for a parameter suggest that the sampler spent
  considerable time in difficult areas of the sampling domain and rejected more
  than half of the samples (replacing them with the previous effective sample).  
  
  If the ratios are low, tightening the priors may help.
  
```{r modelValidation2j, results='markdown', eval=TRUE, mhidden=TRUE, fig.width=6, fig.height=4}
tobacco.brm2$fit |> stan_ess()
```

  Ratios all very high.

```{r modelValidation2k, results='markdown', eval=TRUE, mhidden=TRUE, fig.width=6, fig.height=4}
tobacco.brm3$fit |>
    stan_dens(separate_chains = TRUE, pars = pars)
```

### ggmcmc

The `ggmean` package also as a set of MCMC diagnostic functions.
Lets start with the MCMC diagnostics.

Of these, we will focus on:

- ggs_traceplot: this plots the estimates of each parameter over the post-warmup
  length of each MCMC chain. Each chain is plotted in a different colour, with
  each parameter in its own facet. Ideally, each **trace** should just look like
  noise without any discernible drift and each of the traces for a specific
  parameter should look the same (i.e, should not be displaced above or below
  any other trace for that parameter).

```{r modelValidation2l, results='markdown', eval=TRUE, mhidden=TRUE, fig.width=6, fig.height=7}
tobacco.ggs <- tobacco.brm3 |> ggs(burnin = FALSE, inc_warmup = FALSE)
tobacco.ggs |> ggs_traceplot()
``` 

   The chains appear well mixed and very similar
   
- gss_autocorrelation (autocorrelation function): plots the autocorrelation between successive
  MCMC sample lags for each parameter and each chain
  
```{r modelValidation2m, results='markdown', eval=TRUE, mhidden=TRUE, fig.width=6, fig.height=7}
ggs_autocorrelation(tobacco.ggs)
```

   There is no evidence of autocorrelation in the MCMC samples

- stan_rhat: Rhat is a **scale reduction factor** measure of convergence between the chains.  The closer the
  values are to 1, the more the chains have converged.  Values greater than 1.05
  indicate a lack of convergence.  There will be an Rhat value for each
  parameter estimated.

```{r modelValidation2n, results='markdown', eval=TRUE, mhidden=TRUE, fig.width=6, fig.height=4}
ggs_Rhat(tobacco.ggs)
```

  All Rhat values are below 1.05, suggesting the chains have converged.
  
- stan_ess (number of effective samples): the ratio of the number of effective
  samples (those not rejected by the sampler) to the number of samples provides
  an indication of the effectiveness (and efficiency) of the MCMC sampler.
  Ratios that are less than 0.5 for a parameter suggest that the sampler spent
  considerable time in difficult areas of the sampling domain and rejected more
  than half of the samples (replacing them with the previous effective sample).  
  
  If the ratios are low, tightening the priors may help.
  
```{r modelValidation2o, results='markdown', eval=TRUE, mhidden=TRUE, fig.width=6, fig.height=4}
ggs_effective(tobacco.ggs)
```

  Ratios all very high.

<details><summary>More diagnostics</summary>
```{r modelValidation2p, results='markdown', eval=TRUE, mhidden=TRUE, fig.width=6, fig.height=4}
ggs_crosscorrelation(tobacco.ggs)
```

```{r modelValidation2q, results='markdown', eval=TRUE, mhidden=TRUE, fig.width=6, fig.height=4}
ggs_grb(tobacco.ggs)
```
</details>

### pp check
Post predictive checks provide additional diagnostics about the fit of the
model.  Specifically, they provide a comparison between predictions drawn from
the model and the observed data used to train the model.

<details><summary>See list of available diagnostics by name</summary>
```{r modelValidation5a, results='markdown', eval=TRUE, mhidden=TRUE, fig.width=6, fig.height=4}
available_ppc()
```
</details>

- dens_overlay: plots the density distribution of the observed data (black line)
overlayed ontop of 50 density distributions generated from draws from the model
(light blue).  Ideally, the 50 realisations should be roughly consistent with
the observed data.

```{r modelValidation5b, results='markdown', eval=TRUE, mhidden=TRUE, fig.width=6, fig.height=4}
tobacco.brm3 |> pp_check(type = 'dens_overlay', ndraws = 100)
```
The model draws appear to be consistent with the observed data.

- error_scatter_avg: this plots the observed values against the average
  residuals. Similar to a residual plot, we do not want to see any patterns in
  this plot.  Note, this is not really that useful for models that involve a
  binomial response

```{r modelValidation5c, results='markdown', eval=TRUE, mhidden=TRUE, fig.width=6, fig.height=4}
tobacco.brm3 |> pp_check(type = 'error_scatter_avg')
```

This is not really interpretable

- intervals:  plots the observed data overlayed ontop of posterior predictions
associated with each level of the predictor.  Ideally, the observed data should
all fall within the predictive intervals.


```{r modelValidation5e, results='markdown', eval=TRUE, mhidden=TRUE, fig.width=6, fig.height=4}
tobacco.brm3 |> pp_check(group = 'TREATMENT', type = 'intervals')
tobacco.brm3 |> pp_check(group = 'TREATMENT', type = 'intervals_grouped')
tobacco.brm3 |> pp_check(group = 'TREATMENT', type = 'violin_grouped')
```

The `shinystan` package allows the full suite of MCMC diagnostics and posterior
predictive checks to be accessed via a web interface.

```{r modelValidation5g, results='markdown', eval=TRUE, mhidden=TRUE, fig.width=6, fig.height=4}
#library(shinystan)
#launch_shinystan(tobacco.brm2)
```

### DHARMa residuals

DHARMa residuals provide very useful diagnostics.  Unfortunately, we cannot
directly use the `simulateResiduals()` function to generate the simulated
residuals.  However, if we are willing to calculate some of the components
ourself, we can still obtain the simulated residuals from the fitted stan model.

We need to supply:

- simulated (predicted) responses associated with each observation.
- observed values
- fitted (predicted) responses (averaged) associated with each observation

```{r modelValidation6a, results='markdown', eval=TRUE, mhidden=TRUE, fig.width=8, fig.height=5}
preds <- tobacco.brm4 |> posterior_predict(ndraws = 250,  summary = FALSE)
tobacco.resids <- createDHARMa(simulatedResponse = t(preds),
                            observedResponse = tobacco$NUMBER,
                            fittedPredictedResponse = apply(preds, 2, median),
                            integerResponse = FALSE)
plot(tobacco.resids, quantreg = FALSE)
```

```{r modelValidation6aa, results='markdown', eval=TRUE, mhidden=TRUE, fig.width=8, fig.height=10}
tobacco.resids <- make_brms_dharma_res(tobacco.brm3, integerResponse = FALSE)
wrap_elements(~testUniformity(tobacco.resids)) +
               wrap_elements(~plotResiduals(tobacco.resids, form = factor(rep(1, nrow(tobacco))))) +
               wrap_elements(~plotResiduals(tobacco.resids, quantreg = FALSE)) +
               wrap_elements(~testDispersion(tobacco.resids)) 
```


**Conclusions:**

- the simulated residuals do not suggest any issues with the residuals
- there is no evidence of a lack of fit.

## brms
:::: {.panel-tabset}
`brms` captures the MCMC samples from `stan` within the returned list.
There are numerous ways to retrieve and summarise these samples.  The first
three provide convenient numeric summaries from which you can draw conclusions,
the last four provide ways of obtaining the full posteriors. 

### summary

The `summary()` method generates simple summaries (mean, standard deviation as
well as 10, 50 and 90 percentiles).
	
```{r summariseModel2a, results='markdown', eval=TRUE, mhidden=TRUE, fig.width=8, fig.height=5}
tobacco.brm3 |> summary()
```

```{r summariseModel2a1, results='markdown', eval=TRUE, mhidden=TRUE, fig.width=8, fig.height=5, echo=FALSE}
tobacco.sum <- summary(tobacco.brm3)
```

**Conclusions:**

- the intercept indicates that the Strong treatment has an average of 
  `r round(tobacco.sum$fixed[1,1], 2)` lesions.
- the Weak treatment has `r round(-1*tobacco.sum$fixed[2,1], 2)` fewer lesions. 
- the variance in intercepts across all Leaves is 
  `r round(tobacco.sum$random[[1]][1,1],2)`
- the scale of variance between Leaves is very similar to the variance within Leaves 
  (sigma, `r round(tobacco.sum$spec_pars[1,1], 2)`).

### gather_draws

```{r summariseModel2c, results='markdown', eval=TRUE, mhidden=TRUE, fig.width=8, fig.height=5}
tobacco.brm3 |> get_variables()
tobacco.draw <- tobacco.brm3 |>
    gather_draws(`b.Intercept.*|b_TREAT.*|sd_.*|sigma`,  regex=TRUE)
tobacco.draw
```

We can then summarise this

```{r summariseModel2c1, results='markdown', eval=TRUE, mhidden=TRUE, fig.width=8, fig.height=5}
tobacco.draw |> median_hdci()
```

```{r summariseModel2c3, results='markdown', eval=TRUE, mhidden=TRUE, fig.width=8, fig.height=5,echo=FALSE}
tobacco.gather <- tobacco.brm3 |>
    gather_draws(`b_Intercept.*|b_TREAT.*|sd_.*|sigma`,  regex=TRUE) |>
  median_hdci()
```
