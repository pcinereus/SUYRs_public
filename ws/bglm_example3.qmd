# Scenario

Here is a modified example from @Peake-1993-269.  @Peake-1993-269 investigated the relationship between the number of individuals of invertebrates living in amongst clumps of mussels on a rocky intertidal shore and the area of those mussel clumps.

The aim of the analysis is to investigate the relationship between mussel clump area and the number of non-mussel invertebrate individuals supported in the mussel clump.

# Read in the data

```{r readData, results='markdown', eval=TRUE}
peake <- read_csv("../data/peakquinn.csv", trim_ws = TRUE)
```


# Exploratory data analysis

When exploring these data as part of a frequentist analysis, exploratory data
analysis revealed that the both the response (counds of individuals) and
predictor (mussel clump area) were skewed and the relationship between raw
counds and mussel clump area was not linear.  Furthermore, there was strong
evidence of a relationship between mean and variance. Normalising both reponse
and predictor addressed these issues.  However, rather than log transform the
response, it was considered more appropriate to model against a distribution
that used a logarithmic link function.

The individual observations here ($y_i$) are the observed number of (non mussel
individuals found in mussel clump $i$.  As a count, these might be expected to
follow a Poisson (or perhaps negative binomial) distribution.  In the case of a
negative binomial, the observed count for any given mussel clump area are
expected to be drawn from a negative binomial distribution with a mean of
$\lambda_i$.  All the negative binomial distributions are expected to share the
same degree of dispersion ($\theta$) - that is, the degree to which the
inhabitants of mussell clumps aggregate together (or any other reason for
overdispersion) is independent of mussel clump area and can be estimated as a
constant across all populations.

The natural log of the expected values ($\lambda_i$) is modelled against a
linear predictor that includes an intercept ($\beta_0$) and a slope ($\beta_1$)
associated with the natural log of mussel area.

The priors on $\beta_0$ and $\beta_1$ should be on the natura log scale (since
this will be the scale of the parameters).  As starting points, we will consider
the following priors:

- $\beta_0$: Normal prior centered at 0 with a variance of 5
- $\beta_1$: Normal prior centered at 0 with a variance of 2
- $\theta$: Exponential prior with rate 1


Model formula:
$$
\begin{align}
y_i &\sim{} \mathcal{NB}(\lambda_i, \theta)\\
ln(\lambda_i) &= \beta_0 + \beta_1 ln(x_i)\\
\beta_0 & \sim\mathcal{N}(6,1.5)\\
\beta_1 & \sim\mathcal{N}(0,1)\\
\theta &\sim{} \mathcal{Exp}(1)\\
OR\\
\theta &\sim{} \mathcal{\Gamma}(2,1)\\
\end{align}
$$
