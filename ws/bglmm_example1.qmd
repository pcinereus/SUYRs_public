# Scenario

A plant pathologist wanted to examine the effects of two different
strengths of tobacco virus on the number of lesions on tobacco leaves.
She knew from pilot studies that leaves were inherently very variable
in response to the virus. In an attempt to account for this leaf to
leaf variability, both treatments were applied to each leaf. Eight
individual leaves were divided in half, with half of each leaf
inoculated with weak strength virus and the other half inoculated with
strong virus. So the leaves were blocks and each treatment was
represented once in each block. A completely randomised design would
have had 16 leaves, with 8 whole leaves randomly allocated to each
treatment.

Model formula:
$$
\begin{align}
y_{i,j} &\sim{} \mathcal{N}(\mu_{i,j}, \sigma^2)\\
\mu_{i,j} &=\beta_0 + \bf{Z_j}\boldsymbol{\gamma_j} + \bf{X_i}\boldsymbol{\beta} \\
\beta_0 &\sim{} \mathcal{N}(35, 20)\\
\beta_1 &\sim{} \mathcal{N}(0, 10)\\
\boldsymbol{\gamma_j} &\sim{} \mathcal{N}(0, \boldsymbol{\Sigma})\\
\boldsymbol{\Sigma} &= \boldsymbol{D}({\sigma_l})\boldsymbol{\Omega}\boldsymbol{D}({\sigma_l})\\
\boldsymbol{\Omega} &\sim{} LKJ(\zeta)\\
\sigma_j^2 &\sim{} \mathcal{Cauchy}(0,5)\\
\sigma^2 &\sim{} Gamma(2,1)\
\end{align}
$$

where:

- $\bf{X}$ is the model matrix representing the overall intercept and
  effects of the treatment on the number of lesions.
- $\boldsymbol{\beta}$ is a vector of the population-level effects
  parameters to be estimated.
- $\boldsymbol{\gamma}$ is a vector of the group-level effect parameters
- $\bf{Z}$ represents a cell means model matrix for the random intercepts (and
  possibly random slopes) associated with leaves.
- the population-level intercept ($\beta_0$) has a gaussian prior with location
  of 31 and scale of 10
- the population-level effect ($\beta_1$) has a gaussian prior with location of
  0 and scale of 10
- the group-level effects are assumed to sum-to-zero and be drawn from a
  gaussian distribution with mean of 0 and covariance of $\Sigma$  
- $\boldsymbol{\Sigma}$ is the variance-covariance matrix between the
  groups (individual leaves).  It turns out that it is difficult to
  apply a prior on this covariance matrix, so instead, the covariance
  matrix is decomposed into a correlation matrix
  ($\boldsymbol{\Omega}$) and a vector of variances
  ($\boldsymbol{\sigma_l}$) which are the diagonals ($\boldsymbol{D}$)
  of the covariance matrix.
- $\boldsymbol{\Omega}$ 
$$
\gamma \sim{} N(0,\Sigma)\\
\Sigma -> \Omega, \tau\\
$$
where $\Sigma$ is a covariance matrix.
